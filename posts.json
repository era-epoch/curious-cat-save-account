And about us humans being freaky and problematic is so true\nWe all have flaws but that doesn't deduct our humanity. We've always done weird shit and a quick history search will prove it (or you could still look around or at yourself)\nI love consuming media and recently, it has inspired me to start writing too. And oh god, holding a pen and writing down the story you wanted, in a book, is an amazing experience and that's why I cannot fathom people wanting to limit fiction and how it should be consumed \nI'm also a brown asian and middle class and the city where I live, is secluded from the mainland so there's not much here for us. Most books that arrive here are from the western and European authors with one-two writers from my country squeezing betwee.

Being an anti and consuming bsd\nBsd literally has a pedo, an incestous relationship, a slave owner, non-con elements and the literal mafia. By their logic they shouldn't be watching or reading bsd. Infact they should be trying the hardest to cancel the damn show instead of drooling over the characters \nThis mostly has to do with ships and how some people interpret the characters in their writings or drawings\nI understand that you can be uncomfortable with something and that's alright but antis choose to harass anyone who thinks differently than them. They claim to cleanse a fandom but I've never seen antis provide a safe space; all I see is a cult, ready to hunt down anyone who test their beliefs including its own followers.\nI roll my eyes when I see them call all proshippers pedos but those proshippers always have a minorsdni their bio. They're literally asking children not to interact. And idk if antis realise it but pedos are safer in their space than in proshippers. \nProshippers are willing to admit that they can have pedos on their side but antis are adamant and panic when someone on their side is revealed to be one\nAtp it feels like projection. Worried about someone's morals because of what they consume? Thinking you might be influenced too?  Sorry, that just sounds like a skill issue\nAntis pretend to be morally good yet they'll gang up and bully people. While I have never been harrassed because I don't interact with the fandom much, unfortunately my friends have been\nAnd because you are quite popular I'm sure you receive a a varying selection of death threats. I'm very sorry you have to deal with these chronically online dumbasses. \nI'm sure they would not be able to utter a single word if they meet you outside \n\n Like bsd is a dark media and it's not a surprise if fans want to explore more on it. Antis shouldn't be expecting purity from a media that doesn't have it. They want to drool over the characters? That's alright but they can't really ignore the source material either\n\nI mean look at Asagiri. Look at bsd itself. It's literally a fanfic of dead authors with a wacky yet dark storyline. And he's having fun and doing whatever he wants with it. There is a point I'm trying to make here which I'm unable to bring words to describe it and I'm not sure if you get me but antis are losing the point of fiction\n\nAnd oh, I know my next line is going to be so controversial but Asagiri is a proshipper and so are the artists he works with \nWe are all consuming proshippers art","reply":"babe i could rant about this all day lmao. i have a master's in literature and media studies and i can confidently say \"anti\" and \"proshipper\" are such chronically online, illiterate, and abnormal things to refer to people. its mostly younger people whove never experienced the real world who mostly perpetuate it as well. it also tends to be a mostly western phenomenon, which gives you an idea as to how insanely privileged and braindead a take it even is. like \"ew you ship people with a toxic dynamic that wouldnt be legal in real life\" so does literally everybody else whos normal oh my god. humans have done that since the dawn of time. we have always liked problematic weird freaky shit because humans are by default problematic weird and freaky. anyone who wants to argue theyre not are literally making clowns of themselves.\n\nand yes, the idea of being an anti and consuming bsd also is inherently dumb. (literally why come into the weirdos and freaks fandom if you yourself are not a weirdo and freak like you are literally a shame upon the IRL authors and asagiri, the #1 og bsd weirdo and freak). im not surprised there are so many antis in the bsd fandom bc ive been in fandom spaces for a long time and they are everywhere, but yes it is genuinely mind boggling how stupid people can be. theyre just a perpetual hindrance at this point, but ive long moved past being genuinely bothered by them anymore bc theyre not worth anyones time. to me theyre just arguing at walls and jorking their own micropenis takes. youre right, if they did meet me face to face they wouldnt be so bold as to say rude things just based on fiction. its really just so abnormal. \n\ni agree that asagiri is himself a proshipper, but the very idea of a proshipper is even ridiculous like what does that even mean. \"im a proshipper.\" so you consume fictional content and media like a normal person? why is there even a term for that? thats how humans have always interacted with stories??????? most people are proshippers??????? arguably, ALL people who interact with art in any form are proshippers??????? there is no \"purity\" to attain here because fundamentally art isnt meant to be pure so you therefore cannot interact with it in a \"moralistic\" or \"ethical\" way. like what are people even talking about oh my god","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1362396074,"likes":0,"timestamp":1725786421,"seconds_elapsed":1789691,"comment":"i default everyone on the interwebs to being a fellow american my bad >_<","reply":"please think before you assume someone is american it may be distressing to be thought of as someone coming from the US, as im sure you know (/hj)","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null},"in_response_to":{"id":1362386526,"likes":0,"timestamp":1725744681,"seconds_elapsed":1831431,"comment":"hear me out...

However, his wife Michiko wrote in \"Recollections About Dazai Osamu\" (not official TL as it's only available in Japanese) that Dazai had shown behavior of him being scared of dogs, to the point he just suddenly started climbing up a nearby dirty pile of snow after spotting dogs while on a walk with him. Dan Kazuo also mentions a case in his work \"Dazai Osamu Novel\" how Dazai had tried to drive away a puppy with his favorite walking stick, as the dog was trying to approach him and he was feeling uncomfortable. Another good friend of Dazai's, Yamagishi Gaishi, recalls in \"Dazai Osamu Memorandum\" (no official TL either) how they had been walking in a park in Mitaka, and suddenly a setter breed dog from a nearby house came up to them dashing. Dazai hid behind his friend, and the guy was very aware of it how Dazai was using him as a shield because he was scared of the dog. I feel like that's a plenty of proof that Dazai wasn't the biggest fan of dogs.","reply":"oh yes, thank you for adding this! the original tweet im assuming this is in response to was mostly lighthearted and funny but upon further reflection i did delete it bc it was misleading. im very familiar with real-life dazai and i know he did truly find dogs discomforting, to say the least. he himself joked about it a lot though, which is the approach i tend to take when it comes to dazai and dogs. he did not love them, of course, but i was moreso just talking about how the bsd fandom idea that \"dazai hates dogs\" is a big surface-level since even real-life dazais aversion to dogs was a little bit more complex than he just simply avoided them because dogs show up in his stories quite a bit! he ponders on dogs and their nature compared to humanity a lot, which i always found interesting since im a dog person myself. i have also read a translation of Michiko's statements about her husband's dislike for dogs and i do know about when he climbed up that dirt mound bc he saw some on a walk. i havent been able to find a copy of Kazuo's biography unfortunately but im sure that recollection adds up. i guess i will also add that i think dazais \"relationship\" with dogs is a bit less clear cut than, say ryunosuke akutagawa's with dogs. between them, id say akutagawa genuinely disliked them most, but thats just my opinion. thank you again for adding your thoughts, youre right that my tweet was misleading","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1361500296,"likes":0,"timestamp":1725744020,"seconds_elapsed":1832092,"comment":"I hope you're doing well E.U 🥺\n\nStay safe","reply":"im doing alright my love i hope you are doing good too :)","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1360654489,"likes":0,"timestamp":1725743991,"seconds_elapsed":1832121,"comment":"Do u take in bungo mayoi friends?

and ive also had conversations vice versa. i feel like it all boils down to conceptualizing that proship = good vs anti = bad is useless (like all binaries lol) and you end up going in circles. people will always suck online, so the best we can do is recognize who people are for their actions (however they \"identify\" in the proship/anti discourse) and make our own decisions as to how interact with them (and usually the best course of action is usually blocking and moving on). im sorry to hear that youve been denied validation and a sympathetic ear to your experiences. i wish we were all kinder, but the best we can do is try to be.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

And about us humans being freaky and problematic is so true\nWe all have flaws but that doesn't deduct our humanity.

And oh god, holding a pen and writing down the story you wanted, in a book, is an amazing experience and that's why I cannot fathom people wanting to limit fiction and how it should be consumed \nI'm also a brown asian and middle class and the city where I live, is secluded from the mainland so there's not much here for us.

Being an anti and consuming bsd\nBsd literally has a pedo, an incestous relationship, a slave owner, non-con elements and the literal mafia. By their logic they shouldn't be watching or reading bsd. Infact they should be trying the hardest to cancel the damn show instead of drooling over the characters \nThis mostly has to do with ships and how some people interpret the characters in their writings or drawings\nI understand that you can be uncomfortable with something and that's alright but antis choose to harass anyone who thinks differently than them. They claim to cleanse a fandom but I've never seen antis provide a safe space; all I see is a cult, ready to hunt down anyone who test their beliefs including its own followers.\nI roll my eyes when I see them call all proshippers pedos but those proshippers always have a minorsdni their bio. They're literally asking children not to interact. And idk if antis realise it but pedos are safer in their space than in proshippers. \nProshippers are willing to admit that they can have pedos on their side but antis are adamant and panic when someone on their side is revealed to be one\nAtp it feels like projection. Worried about someone's morals because of what they consume? Thinking you might be influenced too?  Sorry, that just sounds like a skill issue\nAntis pretend to be morally good yet they'll gang up and bully people. While I have never been harrassed because I don't interact with the fandom much, unfortunately my friends have been\nAnd because you are quite popular I'm sure you receive a a varying selection of death threats. I'm very sorry you have to deal with these chronically online dumbasses. \nI'm sure they would not be able to utter a single word if they meet you outside \n\n Like bsd is a dark media and it's not a surprise if fans want to explore more on it. Antis shouldn't be expecting purity from a media that doesn't have it. They want to drool over the characters? That's alright but they can't really ignore the source material either\n\nI mean look at Asagiri. Look at bsd itself. It's literally a fanfic of dead authors with a wacky yet dark storyline.

Being an anti and consuming bsd\nBsd literally has a pedo, an incestous relationship, a slave owner, non-con elements and the literal mafia. By their logic they shouldn't be watching or reading bsd. Infact they should be trying the hardest to cancel the damn show instead of drooling over the characters \nThis mostly has to do with ships and how some people interpret the characters in their writings or drawings\nI understand that you can be uncomfortable with something and that's alright but antis choose to harass anyone who thinks differently than them. They claim to cleanse a fandom but I've never seen antis provide a safe space; all I see is a cult, ready to hunt down anyone who test their beliefs including its own followers.\nI roll my eyes when I see them call all proshippers pedos but those proshippers always have a minorsdni their bio. They're literally asking children not to interact. And idk if antis realise it but pedos are safer in their space than in proshippers. \nProshippers are willing to admit that they can have pedos on their side but antis are adamant and panic when someone on their side is revealed to be one\nAtp it feels like projection. Worried about someone's morals because of what they consume? Thinking you might be influenced too?  Sorry, that just sounds like a skill issue\nAntis pretend to be morally good yet they'll gang up and bully people. While I have never been harrassed because I don't interact with the fandom much, unfortunately my friends have been\nAnd because you are quite popular I'm sure you receive a a varying selection of death threats. I'm very sorry you have to deal with these chronically online dumbasses. \nI'm sure they would not be able to utter a single word if they meet you outside \n\n Like bsd is a dark media and it's not a surprise if fans want to explore more on it. Antis shouldn't be expecting purity from a media that doesn't have it. They want to drool over the characters? That's alright but they can't really ignore the source material either\n\nI mean look at Asagiri. Look at bsd itself. It's literally a fanfic of dead authors with a wacky yet dark storyline.

Do you have any recommendations!","reply":"i agree that mary shelley is god *nod nod* if i could put every page of frankenstein on an elaborate frame and put it on display like in art museums, i would. its brilliance put into words. its gorgeous. if i think too long about it i will cry.\n\nmy answer to your question is mixed. for one, mary shelley was a genius even in her own time and i would say nobody can really compare to her in the vast expanse of literature. that being said, she was also, like everyone, a product of her time and the way she wrote was relatively symptomatic to the Romantic Period, especially in her more naturalistic and post-enlightenment themes. a lot of the great literature produced in the Romantic Period tends to be regarded as poetry though, so i can understand struggling to find novels or longer texts that are like Shelley's style because they tend to be overshadowed by the poets, whom Shelley herself frequently interacted with. i recommend checking out other authors who were active during her time, particularly female authors (i like Ann Radcliffe but i wouldnt ncessarily say shes like Shelley in terms of prose, but she deals with a lot of Gothic themes that Shelley does!). keep in mind that at the time, women writers were relatively rare and had much more obstacles to leap through than their male counterparts, which is why Shelley becoming so famous now is so significant.\n\ni dont think there are any books or authors that have prose like Shelley's, especially in the 21st century, but the same can be said for almost any worthwhile author, i think. what makes them special is that no one else can imitate what they do and we as readers should always be grateful they decided to share their talents with us. still, of course, theres always going to be literature thats beautiful to read because writing adapts with the times but always stays relevant and important. i could definitely recommend you some books published today that i find have beautiful prose, but they dont have the same era-specific vocabulary and writing style that Shelley would have found natural. i think thats a big reason why classics and older texts are still very important to read, because if we just read books with prose imitating what were used to hearing and speaking we miss out on how others before us have spoken and told stories, which would be a shame.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1360157459,"likes":0,"timestamp":1723060717,"seconds_elapsed":4515395,"comment":"i think that the only straight poet ito ever exist was gabriele d’annunzio","reply":"not with that mustache, i fear","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1358805112,"likes":0,"timestamp":1723060624,"seconds_elapsed":4515488,"comment":"Hi Eu! I live in a country where the writing scene isn't the biggest, though I have always dreamt of studying literature and becoming a writer. Do you often see people move (to England or US) for college and this line of work? For the tutelage plus active industry over there? Or can any local English program be good regardless of size, global reputation, names in the faculty etc. \n\nI don't know if I absolutely need something like NYU/Cambridge to get to the level I want to be, if lesser-known programs are sufficient for this, or if I'm overthinking. Does it matter where you study creative writing? Because a lot of my favourite authors are Ivy League and Oxbridge or 'private liberal college with insane staff lineup' grads ... and I can't tell if their success is the program's doing or their innate capabilities. Maybe also because in countries like America there are no shortage of courses, workshops, MFAs and other networks that keep authors active and the industry thriving? I'm not sure how common it is to move overseas just for this. I also fear that if I move, I won't be able to study much of my own country's literature. \n\nWhat do you think? Sorry if this comes across as ignorant/presumptuous. There's a lot I don't know about college applications and the industry. I'm hoping you can share your insight!! Thank you.","reply":"youre not being ignorant or anything at all! yes, i know of a lot of people who move to pursue writing/literature because where they come from just doesnt have the same opportunities as other places. you dont necessarily have to move to england or the US; i find even major cities in your home country has more opportunities than living in a smaller region, but it really is up to you. i wont lie, the eurocentrism in the literary scene is hard to overcome even in \"western\" countries, so even though i wouldnt say moving somewhere for school isnt your only option, its still worthwhile, i believe. i cant really speak for the quality of western universities (lol) but they are regarded with more esteem (again, eurocentrism) so even if you wont get the \"best\" education over here, youll at least be equipped with some other useful things to get by in the field like networks, experience, faculty introduction, etc. \n\ni think NYU, Cambridge, and Ivy leagues in general are very overrated, especially now. sure, theyre very good schools but i think they are more trouble than theyre worth, especially regarding money and stress. i think its good to be ambitious, but i also dont think its fair to judge someone based on the school they do their studies in. my favorite authors are all from top-class schools too but they also lived in a time when it was really easy to enter such universities, unlike now when theres so much more to consider like SAT scores, extra-curriculars, volunteering, work experience, and, of course, generational wealth and money. so i dont really judge myself for not going to Harvard. its honestly just what you make of the cards that are dealt you. of course, it definitely matters where you study, -- if you want to pursue literature or writing i recommend picking schools with well-respected and well funded arts and humanities programs -- but its more dependent on you as a person and what works for you rather than if the school is \"good\" or \"bad.\" i myself couldnt afford to go to a top-class university -- let alone enter a department that fitted my goals completely, but overall im satisfied with what ive done because university isnt the end of the world and theres still more ahead of me career-wise, but now i at least have two degrees to show for it, yknow?\n\nall this being said, i am not a guidance counsellor and i cant give you as much help with the decisions youre making as someone from your home country whose more educated on schooling abroad and what options are available to your specific case. so i highly recommend asking someone more knowledgeable in how academia works, but i am also here to offer up general encouragement and support. i hope some of this helps. i think youre thinking about it a good amount but also dont forget about how this is a very exciting time for you. you can do this! follow your dreams!","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1360130426,"likes":0,"timestamp":1723059628,"seconds_elapsed":4516484,"comment":"is it gay if i, italian poet known for my sad poems (and somehow not for my brighter side, that is really beautiful), write my beloved best friend a letter that says: \"ranieri, my dear. will this letter find you still in naples? i must tell you that i can no longer live without you, that a morbid impatience to see you again has overtaken me, and i am certain that if you delay even a little, i will die of melancholy before i have had you. farewell, farewell.\"","reply":"hmmm i dunno chief seems like theyre just very good friends to me 😌👍🏽 (/j)","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1360130110,"likes":0,"timestamp":1723059589,"seconds_elapsed":4516523,"comment":"SO I TAKE IT AS YOU STAN A KPOP GROUP?

He knew Ango was a government plant and used him to get info on Mimic which he then used to get Dazai to recruit Odasaku. The fact Odasaku got to be such a low level employee (as evidenced by him listing the kind of work he was doing for the mafia whilst at the bar) for so long clearly shows Mori was keeping him in reserve for the exact battle he knew would ensue when Mimic arrived in Japan. I honestly think it's some of Asagiri's finest writing and I wish he would be less subtle. He gives far too much credit to the readers. Especially with 55minutes as well. I enjoy it but it gets frustrating as hell when dealing with anime only fans.","reply":"mori is my favorite bsd antagonist! i agree that ironically even though he was one of the first \"villains,\" the bsd fandom tends to overlook him and how well written he is. i think a large reason for him being underrated is bc a lot of his \"best moments\" arent in the anime or are toned down, like just how sinister he was in dark era. i think the anime adaptation of the light novel is brilliant but ofc they had to cut some stuff out. mori as the mafia boss was truly evil in that light novel, especially with how he did not hesitate to use dazai and his friends for his own benefit. like there was tat part where asagiri mentions how dazai yaps to mori all about his new friends and how he admires odasaku and mori listened to him, almost like a guardian listening, which was undoubtedly he kind of attention dazai was unconsciously seeking when he told mori, but in the end mori gathered all the information and didnt let emotion get in the way. he knew ango was a triple agent but he didnt tell dazai and let him figure it out himself all too late. he knew odasaku would be a good trump card someday and when he was proven right he didnt hesitate to use him even though dazai clearly loved odasaku and would be devastated with his death. that confrontation scene with dazai and mori right before dazai rushes to try and save odasaku from gide is so chilling to me, because these are two people who for three years have been at each other's side and played at being a child under someone's wing, but in the end mori just used him and didnt care about his feelings more than the mafia.\n\nits really fascinating! especially since i believe mori isnt as heartless or cold as asagiri wants us to believe. i do think he feels emotion, regret, and sometimes even guilt, but whats scary about him is that he can put all that aside \"for the good of the organization.\" thats why his line about being both king and slave to the mafia is so crucial to understanding him. hes really fascinating as a character in his subtlety, which is why he compels me more than the other antagonists.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1358348503,"likes":0,"timestamp":1723057212,"seconds_elapsed":4518900,"comment":"Would you have fic recs, or entire author profiles to give a shout-out to?

I wonder why?\nNow, I myself have noticed a lot of Dazai-sensei's hate for ridiculous reason and personally it all makes no sense to me. I've seen a few try to cancel him too!

What is your opinion on this?","reply":"trying to cancel dead authors because of \"modern\" wokeness is the epitome of stupidity, especially when they have to stoop so low as to make wild accusations based on hearsay and \"facts\" they completely warp and make up. theres such a sense of entitlement and arrogance to it too, like \"oh i am SO much better than the thousands upon thousands of people who admire dazai to this day and have found his works inspiring bc i was uncomfortable reading one of his works about a woman that didnt fit my modern-day feminist standards. gotcha! youre all bad people for liking dazai!\" theres just no intelligence or capacity for nuanced thinking there. its a harmful mindset too. on top of being blatantly disrespectful and spreading misinformation, its a very black and white way to view the world and history; as if there can be \"pure\" and \"unproblematic\" authors when by definition literature is meant to evoke intense emotions in all of us, not just feel-good ones. as far as i know, dazai did NOT write such a poem (he did write some poems, but i havent encountered any of that description). as for the double suicide, the one in kamakura is really suspicious, i agree: he'd barely known the woman a week and he was still technically married to someone else during the time, so him being the only survivor is quite astounding, but dazai has voiced his regret and shame for the incident time and time again. its not like he murdered that woman and gloated about not getting any consequences for it. dazai wasnt the type of person to force himself on others in that way either, so it wouldnt be fair or even factually correct to claim he was completely at fault for the failed double suicide. \n\nas for the one that actually killed him, its generally agreed that both him and Tomie agreed to it, yes. some people even speculate that SHE coerced him into going through with the suicide because of how manic and obsessed she was at the time they agreed to do it. this is of course just a theory, but dazai and tomies relationship at the end had certainly grown very toxic on both sides, so the blame cant be totally on dazai either. \n\ni would agree with you that, at heart, dazai was good. he tried his best and failed most of the time, but i think if he'd just lived in a time and environment that accommodated for his illnesses (depression, suicidality, drug addiction, alcoholism, etc.) he wouldve been much different (and better). he also suffered a lot of financial issues once his family cut him off, and let's not forget how he lived through two world wars. trust me when i say that i am the LAST person to defend a man. dazai wasnt perfect and a lot of the time he was a complete mess and an idiot. i dont blame people for disliking him for many reasons despite him being one of my favorite authors, but for people to insist everybody should dislike him and that hes \"overrated\" is just plain false.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1358152578,"likes":0,"timestamp":1722891513,"seconds_elapsed":4684599,"comment":"A few \"heavy readers\" claim they can tell when a writer is/was a highly intelligent person by their writing. Intelligence is a fuzzy concept to me, tho. I can tell what it isn't, but I can't tell what it is.\nHave you ever heard that talk, and/or do you have opinions on it? While I used to read a lot and these days I write a lot, my degree is in humanities for something else other than literature. So I'm not up-to-date if there's a go-to theory for analysis of these things. Or if, perhaps, this kind of take is bs lol.\n\nFor the record, we don't exactly do the \"English major\" thing where I live. It's not an English-speaking country to begin with.","reply":"i think intelligence is relative and inherently a funny thing when it comes to writing. like i acknowledge a lot of Lord Byron's poems are brilliant, but does that mean he himself was intelligent? certainly not. he thought very highly of himself, of course, and he was educated and knew a lot, but at the end of the day id classify him as an idiot. and honestly i think the best, most human, and interesting writing comes from the authors who willingly admit they dont know anything and are unintelligent themselves. writing isn't a pretentious \"who is smarter than who\" competition, and i feel like a lot of the \"heavy readers\" who try to take it more seriously than it is are missing a key major point in the discourse. the eurocentrism and priorization of western (aka white) texts also plays a part in all of the \"intelligence\" debate, as its just another way to reinsert western canon as \"superior\" because it incorporates rules, techniques, and styles that western scholars already admire. so basically my answer is that, yes, i agree with you that intelligence is a fuzzy concept, and i dont think its a very static one either. someone can show bouts of genius through their writing but also produce some very bad writing. no kind of art is a great representative of the artist's personality or attributes, they are just glimpses and windows into somebody else's human soul. \n\nin general though i do agree writing and reading makes you more intelligent. its been scientifically proven. but its how and why people apply that learned intelligence/knowledge from reading and writing to their work is where it gets kinda fuzzy, like you said. i guess at the end of the day its really a case to case basis and something we as readers have to judge for ourselves when we encounter other people's works, and they shall have to do the same for us with our pieces","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1358236071,"likes":0,"timestamp":1722890854,"seconds_elapsed":4685258,"comment":"GOOD LUCK FOR TNE BOOK (what book is it?)","reply":"the book i was placing a bid for was the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition (Penguin Threads) edition of Little Women y Lou(isa) May Alcott!!! ive been wanting the book for YEARS bc the edition is so beautiful and rare AND I GOT IT !!!!!

Each short story in the collection is also preceded by a small biography of the author + the work in context with their other stuff, so i highly recommend it!)\n-The Penguin Book of Japanese Short Stories (this one has a good introduction by Haruki Murakami, but the stories themselves are more contemporary and outside the timeline i know most about, which is pre and postwar JP literature. still good though)\n-The Penguin Book of Japanese Verse (i enjoyed this one a lot. it's a little difficult to navigate but it's filled with great information on Japanese literature pre-Meiji Era in context of poetry, which is crucial to understanding JP literature in general since there're so many parts of the lyrical and poetic that still endure to this day)\n\nas for good books to get you started, here are some i think would be good (feel free to read any of them or none of them):\n-Naomi by Jun'chirou Tanizaki\n-Blue Bamboo: Tales by Dazai Osamu\n-Rashomon and 17 Other Stories by Akutagawa Ryuunosuke\n-Confessions of a Mask by Yukio Mishima\n-The Decagon House Murders by Yukito Ayatsuji\n-A Tale for the Time Being by Ruth Ozeki\n-Obasan by Joy Kogawa \n-Sanshiro by Natsume Soseki\n-Japanese Ghost Stories by Lafcadio Hearn \n-Tokyo Ueno Station by Yu Miri","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1358151479,"likes":0,"timestamp":1722889891,"seconds_elapsed":4686221,"comment":"hi fave account. thoughts on nabokov","reply":"( f-fav account? 🥺🫶🏽) i like nabokov well enough but hes not one of my favorites. too modernist for me. as a book i didnt like Lolita but as a piece of literature i acknowledge its a masterpiece and i honestly use it as a litmus test to see if people are literate or not. like if someone goes ugh ew Nabokov’s a pedophile ew just look at Lolita ill simply just cut their head off bc no.

As someone who is clearly not white, and who went to highschool and is currently in uni surrounded by a large amount of white people, I just feel a sense of unease and discomfort around them. Especially because I'm low income and a lot of these people are all rich white kids with no common decency or sense of reality. I am literally half white too, and while my family is fine, I never realized how racist and weird other white people were until I moved into a highly conservative area. I just want to know if you feel/felt the same way? I don't hate white people btw, I just am beginning to feel uneasy unless they show they aren't racist first.

Blue blood vessels stood out transparently on the back of my hand, and I could feel my body grow strangely heavy. One of the other students in my class, a small dark fellow, and I had a secret crush on each other. We would invariably walk home together. If even our little fingers happened to brush against each other, we would both blush. Once when we were walking back along the road behind school, he found a newt swimming in the waterweed-choked ditch between the fields, and he caught it and silently gave it to me. I hated newts, but I stuffed it into my handkerchief, pretending to be delighted. I brought it back to the house and set it loose in the little pond in the inner garden. The newt swam around, turning its short neck in every direction; but when I checked the next morning, it was nowhere to be found.\"\n\ni say interpret it however you want bc we'll never really know what dazai meant or if this even happened. ive seen a handful of people interpreting dazai as being queer/closeted because he also mentions being afraid of women but having strong sexual desires, but ofc its all just conjecture. its iffy to speculate on real life people's sexualities/sexual feelings, especially through just their writing, so thats why i dont like it when skk shippers carelessly cite this passage without knowing the context or applying critical thought to it","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1356590206,"likes":0,"timestamp":1720583231,"seconds_elapsed":6992881,"comment":"That random person's comment \"this exact novel you are talking about was written right before he tried to hang himself in the forest\" made me snort so bad, as \"Recollections\" (or \"Memories\" depending on translation) was published between April and July of 1933.

I‘d greatly appreciate ur perspective as a fellow student/academic who has experience with mental illness. i hope this rant finds u in good health wherever u are! 🥰","reply":"hello hello! i understand where youre coming from. my doctors + mental health specialists also feel like theyre not helping, but i learned to have relatively low expectations bc theyre not there to solve my issues theyre there to help me in any way they can. its true that seeking resources and asking what your options are is a good first step, but i also understand how it feels when it feels like when youve hit a wall and nothings changing except your frustration keeps mounting. my advice is to forgive yourself. that may be a surface-level tip, but i found that once i just accepted \"today i need to wallow in bed. what needs to get done will get done some way or another.\" the self hatred and self pity are huge burdens, esp when we compare ourselves to the past when we were \"better\" or \"healthier.\" the shame consumes us more than the actual illness, i find. as for the extensions, i suggest communicating with your supervisors about making a \"schedule\" that accommodates your mental health while also giving you enough incentive to get it actually done. i always tell myself \"its better to be done than perfect,\" and i ask my professors if they could make \"outlines\" or \"brain maps\" for me in terms of when they expect my work to be done, and i do the same. its back and forth; sometimes setting deadlines works and sometimes i just have to tell them to kindly screw off im dealing with a lot rn. the best way to get the care you need is to *communicate.* the accessibility programs are good, but theyre never one-size-fit-all, obviously. its important you talk to people about what works for you or possibilities. \n\ni dont have all the answers. i still struggle with burnout, lack of motivation, executive dysfunction, etc. what's worked for me is doing my best everyday, and taking it day by day. i try not to compare and when the intrusive thoughts or impostor syndrome come, i force myself to just stop thinking about it even by just listening to music or taking a nap. there definitely is a balance, but its not static. every single day you have to ask yourself \"what do i need? how can i get it? am i being fair to myself right now?\" basically, you have more control than you think you do, and when things feel uncontrollable, you can still choose options, and you should always choose to be kind to yourself. you ARE capable! never forget that","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1351825365,"likes":0,"timestamp":1713946483,"seconds_elapsed":13629629,"comment":"The most funny thing happened now.

Same with reading, I used to read thick novels pretty quickly and actually gave love to it but now, everything seems boring. \nI'm also very busy these days with several exams to give the next few months so it's hard to manage my time. \nAnd, I really want to get back to writing. I like movies, creating stories and concepts and I jot them down sometimes but I feel like I am lacking the creativity and skill to finish them. I am aware that it takes time to improve your skills but I've been burnt out for a very long time and it's depressing because I used to find meaning in what I did. Writing used to be my voice","reply":"youre not being selfish! abuse my cc all you want, thats what its here for. youre not alone in how you feel. the good news is that humans are naturally creative creatures, so even if it feels like that \"spark\" is gone, itll always come back one way or another, and then it may leave for a vacation again, and then come back. dont worry. just be patient. esp since you have a history of creativity in the first place.\n\nthat being said, i understand that its hard to stay interested when the whole world and life keeps telling you to focus on something else, and the less time you have for something, the less youre \"in the zone\" to keep the art and creativity flowing. on top of being patient (and kind!) with yourself, i say dont make so assumptions about where you are (i.e. you said your writing is \"horrible and flat\"), but instead you should remind yourself of what it could be eventually. so take it slow -- and i mean *as slow as you need,* since there's no time limit so long as you keep wanting it. the thing about reading + writing is that its never boring bc you can never exhaust the endless supply -- you just have to go out looking for (and being open to receiving) whatll give you that spark. you say youre burnt out, but you mentioned that you still like movies and making up stories + concepts, which i say is still its own form of reading and writing, albeit not the physical, literal acts of it. i think reading + writing are one of those things humans just do naturally and develop on their own without even thinking; and it never truly leaves you. youre constantly improving, learning, and *doing* something thatll inform your outlook when it comes to those things. i understand its scary and needs confidence, but stop expecting so much from yourself and just look forward to what i guarantee is already promised to you. it *will* come back and, based on what you told me, i dont even think it left; you just need to be a little more kind to yourself and stop saying none of what youre doing now has no meaning, bc thats not true. \n\ni hope that helps a little. trust me when i say your voice is not and will never be lost. take care and i hope youre doing okay too!","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1349940765,"likes":0,"timestamp":1712565437,"seconds_elapsed":15010675,"comment":"Eu when do you know if you’re ace or if you’ve just been really depressed since years?

Rediscovering literature as an adult has been just about the best thing that’s happened to me. \n\nI’m super butthurt though because I’ve done poorly in literature class at university. I enrolled in a few units because I figured enjoying reading was a good enough reason to do so. I put genuine effort into the assessments - I’m just not the best at writing and still haven’t fully grasped critical analysis yet. I’m not sure if I just need more time and practice (likely bc this is my first essay-based unit in college), or if the style of learning just isn’t for me. \n\nEu, have you seen very below average essayists come around with time? Is it possible for class to shape me into a better thinker and writer? To what extent is a ‘’literary person’’ made over the years vs born with the critical eye? Does research help? Because I'm just staring at the book on my own out here. Some days I worry that English analysis and storytelling are patterns of communication I wasn’t born with, and that I should go back to figures and arithmetic which I compute with best. Analysis doesn’t click for me and I’m scared that it never will. Eu, do you believe that such a thing is possible? \n\nNow that I am older, my relationship with language has changed. Stories are so wonderful to me, and I would give anything to study the theory and craft of it regardless of how terribly mediocre I am. The more I read, the more I love books and the more tempted I am to elect another English unit. But whenever I do poorly on an essay it puts me off reading for months. I shouldn’t attach the acts of reading and writing for fun with academic performance but it’s hard not to when at times one feels like a direct measure of the other.","reply":"yes, all you ask me is totally possible. ive seen it done and i will continue to see it done. im not exaggerating when i say anything can happen. yes, class can shape you into a better thinker/writer. a literary person is not born and they are not \"made,\" they are in a constant state of development, which is how humans naturally are. yes, research helps, but it's not everything. youre right that you shouldnt attach what you love + what you enjoy with school and academic performance, but of course i understand all too well what you mean that they sometimes seem like they have to go hand in hand. \n\nin terms of formalized academics, something people tend to misconstrue with English as a subject is that it's not a contest of who likes reading the most (if only!). the classes are designed to make you analyze literature and communicate your ideas in written/oral form so you may apply such skills to a specialized career (it doesnt have to be literary). much like how math classes arent just about who can solve all the equations, and is actually about applying the mathematical knowledge you learn to real-life problems and scenarios -- whether it's to cure cancer or design a new building or create a robot. the skills you learn are versatile. it's the same with humanities classes. you *are* born with a natural curiosity and desire to learn/analyze things. it just takes different forms and degrees because you are unique. \n\nthe basic point of school is for you to learn and be taught how to do something, so of course struggle is going to be inevitable. its true that some people are just born with a knack for certain things, but talent means nothing without hard work, and nobody is the best at everything. allow yourself that grace. practice and determination are a huge part of improvement, but i also cant emphasize enough how just *loving* it is so crucial. i see so many of my classmates work hard and do everything right to get all the good grades, but they dont *love* it, and i think thats more sad, because they're only able to see stories through that narrow mindset of \"if i can analyze it well enough i'll get rewarded w a good mark.\" stories are their own reward! you dont need me to tell you that. im sure you already know. no amount of academic achievement or high essay marks can get you a love for reading, which is whats most important and irreplaceable. im so, so happy youve been able to rediscover books again. hold onto that love. thats the winning ticket. its okay if you feel discouraged sometimes. stories will be there when you take it up again, regardless of essay grades or book slumps, because the good news is that it loves you back, and always will.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1348730268,"likes":0,"timestamp":1711089904,"seconds_elapsed":16486209,"comment":"Eu how do you make adulting interesting hellllp I can feel myself becoming more adult and it’s not fun :(","reply":"find beauty in the simplistic and embrace the peace in the mundane. also just let yourself be totally and completely unhinged batshit levels of insane obsessed with your silly lil gay ships on the internet and youll be fine","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1348761503,"likes":0,"timestamp":1711089392,"seconds_elapsed":16486721,"comment":"Hello, what was the first book you even read from literature?

I’ve seen different takes on this. Some famous authors attribute their literacy to vocational learning, having spent more time in libraries than at college. Others have said that ‘good art is intelligent art’ and having sound understanding of literary theory is absolutely imperative. I’ve also noticed a lot of critically acclaimed authors today have received their undergraduates in English. Not sure if this is correlation or causation. I’m at a cross-roads deciding which direction I should take my life. I really do want to write someday, though I wonder if this is something I can do on my own or whether I should look for a writing workshop or literature masters program (though I'm unsure if this is a good idea because I don't have an undergraduate in humanities). Sometimes I worry how far I can get working alone with a self-prescribed syllabus of reading and writing. What are your thoughts Eu?","reply":"it depends on what you consider is \"enough\" knowledge of literary theory and literacy in general. of course, i advocate for learning as much as you can, so i would definitely say it doesnt hurt to know literary theory; it will always help you moving forward with not just writing, but with anything (knowledge has value, even if you dont necessarily learn it for a specific goal in mind). as for the debate on \"good art is intelligent art,\" im hesitant to agree with it. i dont think art is that simple, since good art isn't just dependent on the artist's intent (i.e. intelligence), but also people's reception of it, and that's completely separate and uncontrollable (to some extent). for example, there are countless *countless* poets who've used poetic devices, literary mechanics, rhyme scheme, etc. to a meticulous, almost obsessive point that, objectively, in terms of work and effort put into their craft, they've produced \"good\" art, but most of those are never considered as \"good\" art because most people dont even notice the amount of detail put into it altogether. thats why i think there are definitely degrees to it; not one thing determines \"good\" art, whether it's artistic intelligence, historical reception, cultural influence, fame, monetary value, specialization, etc. i think the vast expanse of good art are permutations of those combined factors.\n\nbasically (and this is quite typical when it comes to debates about the arts), my answer is yes and no. i think creativity, art, and human innovation are too transcendentally intrinsic to humanity and therefore too complex to make generalizations like \"good art is intelligent art\" or that \"you have to have a degree in English to write well.\" i dont think thats fair, and it has classist, ableist, patriarchal, etc. undertones to it bc a lot of \"intelligence\" pertaining to art is gatekept/inaccessible to the masses. yet, knowledge is still valuable, and it benefits one to develop a craft because no one -- and i do mean NO ONE -- learns alone. we need each other to expand our horizons, so even if you think youre all by yourself in your field or making up your own syllabus, youre not, because we're all doing the exact same thing at the end of the day. in terms of where you want to go with your life (creatively and in general), you dont have to pick, nor should you have to. there are no big, easy answers to anything. be patient and kind to yourself. sign up for a writing workshop if you want, but dont beat yourself up if it doesnt work out, or if you just dont like it. dont compare yourself to other artists bc everyones backgrounds and artistic journeys are so different. there are no perfect answers, but the absence of them lies our potential, and with that, i will always say take a chance on it.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

Even if Dazai does intentionally isolate himself from the ADA, would that really be enough for the other members to not think of him as part of the group? That would mean that him pushing them away because Dazai is who he is is working, which.... man, that's terribly sad, and I don't like thinking about it.... I know they all care about him and I know they would never exclude him, even if he tries to exclude himself, or at least that's what I'd like to believe. I'd like to think he knows they care about him, even if it's hard for him to accept it and respond to it for all the obvious reasons. But like even in chapter 91, Atsushi was excited to have the agency all finally back together again, before remembering that some of them were still missing..... and he thought of Tanizaki and Kenji, but not Dazai. And then even when Tanizaki and Kenji appeared, none of them seemed to remember that they were still missing Dazai, Atsushi included. It just feels really weird, and wrong, I've never understood any of these moments, but that one most of all, since it's Atsushi 😭 Maybe Asagiri just made a goof, idk; the alternative is too depressing and unrealistic to me.","reply":"yes, fukuzawa was thinking abt the ones immediately in danger, hence why he included ranpo as well. through All Men Are Created Equal, he also has an established bond w all of them (he can sense if one of them is in trouble/has died), and his deep connection to ranpo goes beyond that even if he doesnt have an ability bc Fukuzawa raised him. if you think about it, dazai is essentially the only one fukuzawa doesn't have a solid \"bond\" with because NLH (as far as we know) nullifies AMACE, so he isnt \"linked\" to dazai the same way he is with the others. it isnt even a seniority issue either since hes much closer to kyouka and atsushi despite being the newest agency members bc they have abilities he can help modulate. keep in mind also that fukuzawa knows dazai was meant to be mori's protege, and for someone whos spent as much time with mori, ive no doubt fukuzawa can see his influence still lingering on dazai even after all this time. im not saying that he doesnt care about dazai or sees him as a non-member (thats not true), its just that the circumstances surrounding dazais past and entry into the ada will always be complicated, which i think attests to bsd's good writing since its not \"happy times found family haha,\" which would be nice, sure, but the way the ada works -- the things they dont talk about, how ride or die they are for each other, all of them possessing interconnected trauma, etc. -- is fascinating, and i think dazai really brings that out. it is also largely deliberate, like i said, since dazai himself doesnt really know how to be part of a group (hes been on his own most of his life; odasaku dying and 2 years in the agency wont change that). that being said, i dont think its \"working\" per se, bc it is very obvious no matter how much dazai tries to keep his distance through clownery or being \"devil's advocate,\" the agency does care for him, especially now that atsushi's with them\n\nalso that moment with kenji and tanizaki, yes, i was thinking of it too, but my counter-argument for that is that atsushi was literally thinking about dazai during the first days of the terrorist attack plot. when he realized the decay of angels was plotting against them, atsushis immediate instinct was to look for dazai and ask his help, and dazais shown up in atsushis mind countless times afterward, advising him to think on his own feet. so even if atsushi didnt \"think\" of dazai in that moment, hes always on his mind. he knows dazais part of the family. in fact, id say he insists on it","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null},"in_response_to":{"id":1347635075,"likes":0,"timestamp":1709674551,"seconds_elapsed":17901562,"comment":"hi eu! what do you think of dazai being excluded from fukuzawa's flashback of the agency in the recent chapter?

and we dont know for sure the specifics of how All Men Are Created Equal and No Longer Human interact. ive always been interested if it goes beyond simple nullification since NLH is meant to be based on touch alone, but Fukuzawa's never physically touching Dazai. i think theres also proof that dazai can \"control\" NLH a little better than he could in pm, but i digress. i also dont think the ada-pm member exchange is as legit as everyone else thinks (i doubt we got that whole conversation between mori and fukuzawa outlining the \"Deal\" the made, or if there was even a deal to begin with since mori's just a straight up liar and i dont trust anything he says), but i also digress. \n\nanyway, from what i understand, asagiri and harukawa are excluding dazai on purpose from these \"ada\" group photos. it isnt just the photos or flashbacks either: even if he is a member of the ada and his colleagues care about him, dazai's always been the outsider. any time the ada are together, he is always off to the side or watching silently in the background enjoying just watching. in mayoi events, his cards always describe him going off by himself at events while everyone else has fun. in wan, he also does this (him not participating in the hotpot episode bc he \"taste tested\" earlier, him not lighting anything before the fireworks just joking he'll make a big one explode, him going to the museum to see hirotsu instead of going to kyouka's acceptance celebration despite the fact that he single-handedly is the reason she aced her exam in the first place). blah blah. dazai's a loner. its deliberate and its all very sad. especially since throughout this entire arc all hes been thinking about is the ada and mentions them consistently. theres not enough room on cc to fully discuss what i think about all this, but basically i think dazai's \"isolation\" is one of those things that the ada never talks about but is going to have to eventually. because those \"flashbacks\" that dont involve dazai almost always happen through the other members' pov but not atsushi's (its happened once from atsushi's pov from what i can remember). to atsushi, dazai *is* the agency, thats why he always notices when dazais not around despite everyone just accepting it as fact","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1347772776,"likes":0,"timestamp":1709724995,"seconds_elapsed":17851118,"comment":"Wait...

Bram Stoker, however, has a little bit more of a connection. no, he wasn't spanish, but he was born in Dublin, Ireland, which has a heavy Catholic influence, so he wouldve known a lot about Catholic history, symbolism, culture, etc. (Dostoyevsky wouldve too, but Stoker actually lived in it, as you can see in all the Catholic/Gothic elements in his fiction, notably Dracula).\n\nDracula is directly inspired by Romanian leader Vlad III AKA Vlad the Impaler AKA Vlad Dracula, who was alive during the Spanish Inquisition. he wasn't, like, going around burning witches and Protestants (at least not out of his own Catholic piety), but he interacted with a lot of key historical figures that were directly involved in the Crusades and socio-religious politics going on at the time, like King Matthias Corvinus from Hungary and the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II, which are both alluded to in the most recent bsd chapter.\n\ni made a quick thread explaining the basics, which you can read here: https://x.com/eu_gi_oh/status/1764320244296818760?s=20. all of it is information easily found online though so if youre curious it's really interesting to learn about all these interconnections that bsd invites us to make, so i recommend checking it out!","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1347751020,"likes":0,"timestamp":1709675123,"seconds_elapsed":17900990,"comment":"Judas!Fyodor anon here, i think in my state of very very sleepy i confused the Bible with Death Note.

i believe this has happened before, but i can't recall when. some people theorised its further proof dazai will be the one chosen to be sent to the mafia, while others said it's not because other members in the agency like naomi weren't included in the flashback as fukuzawa specifically recalled those affected by his ability.","reply":"its happened before, yes. i dont know the specific instances, but its dazai so i took notice. the theory that its \"proof\" dazai'll be the one to be sent to the mafia based on that seems weak to me though. even if from fukuzawa's pov he doesnt see dazai as part of the ada or he already decided he was going to pick him to transfer, theres no way dazais gonna go back to the pm thats narratively impossible at this point in the story. the point about naomi or haruno not being in the \"flashback\" bc theyre not affected by fukuzawa's ability is alright, i suppose, but then why is ranpo there? and we dont know for sure the specifics of how All Men Are Created Equal and No Longer Human interact. ive always been interested if it goes beyond simple nullification since NLH is meant to be based on touch alone, but Fukuzawa's never physically touching Dazai. i think theres also proof that dazai can \"control\" NLH a little better than he could in pm, but i digress. i also dont think the ada-pm member exchange is as legit as everyone else thinks (i doubt we got that whole conversation between mori and fukuzawa outlining the \"Deal\" the made, or if there was even a deal to begin with since mori's just a straight up liar and i dont trust anything he says), but i also digress. \n\nanyway, from what i understand, asagiri and harukawa are excluding dazai on purpose from these \"ada\" group photos. it isnt just the photos or flashbacks either: even if he is a member of the ada and his colleagues care about him, dazai's always been the outsider. any time the ada are together, he is always off to the side or watching silently in the background enjoying just watching. in mayoi events, his cards always describe him going off by himself at events while everyone else has fun. in wan, he also does this (him not participating in the hotpot episode bc he \"taste tested\" earlier, him not lighting anything before the fireworks just joking he'll make a big one explode, him going to the museum to see hirotsu instead of going to kyouka's acceptance celebration despite the fact that he single-handedly is the reason she aced her exam in the first place). blah blah. dazai's a loner. its deliberate and its all very sad. especially since throughout this entire arc all hes been thinking about is the ada and mentions them consistently. theres not enough room on cc to fully discuss what i think about all this, but basically i think dazai's \"isolation\" is one of those things that the ada never talks about but is going to have to eventually. because those \"flashbacks\" that dont involve dazai almost always happen through the other members' pov but not atsushi's (its happened once from atsushi's pov from what i can remember). to atsushi, dazai *is* the agency, thats why he always notices when dazais not around despite everyone just accepting it as fact","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1347717561,"likes":0,"timestamp":1709673649,"seconds_elapsed":17902464,"comment":"Hey Eu, I have to write a presentation about Paul Verlaine for my French course and now I don’t know what my teacher wants me to present, his life, his influences, his works, his fucking dick size I don’t know.

Reading your fic CIHY and, as a literature nerd myself (Dazai in this fic is like literally me hehe 😙), am really enjoying it. I especially love your prose and diction, dear Author haha.

I simply MUST know... 😫","reply":"aaah im glad you like CIHY! thanks for reading it im happy my people who are also in literature have generally found it amusing hehe\n\nas for the dracula essay, yes, it's inspired from an essay i wrote when i was in undergrad that actually won me an award for its research into queer topics + history. my argument was basically that the first part of the novel where jonathan harker and dracula are staying in the castle together, it's stoker's quasi-fantastical reimagining of gay domesticity between two husbands (bc they do essentially live as a married couple when johnathan stays there; he imagines himself in a woman's position and doing female roles when writing his letters; dracula does the domestic chores; they converse during intimate moments like when johnathan's shaving; there was also that line about how \"i, too, can love\" when dracula saves johnathan from being assaulted by the three vampiresses who attack him, etc). i compared stoker's closeted desires to henry irving, which is infamous in the literary community bc they were so gay but had a hint of caution bc stoker was also witnessing the infamous oscar wilde trial for \"gross indecency\" happening in england at the time. dracula was a direct result of all the socio-queer politics that stoker experienced both as a closeted gay man and a \"passing\" straight gentleman of society, and it reflects a lot in the novel. there're countless references in the book that have homosexual undertones -- not to mention how the gothic genre is inherently about the \"other\" and \"othered bodies\" AKA queer people and their \"forbidden\" desires","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1347558067,"likes":0,"timestamp":1709548294,"seconds_elapsed":18027819,"comment":"Thank you Eu for your insightful analyses on the new chapter bc all I’m thinking of is that one bsd wan episode where Dazai told Atsushi he can grow shrimp back by its butt and I get this cursed image of Gogol growing his own dos-kun","reply":"oh youre very welcome, i was happy to send out my thoughts hehe. also ive been thinking abt that episode ever since nikolai took fyodor's arm and started cradling it like that cause i used to be a biologist and know a bit about propagation so dazais joke was really funny to me and i made jokes about it too","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1347622189,"likes":0,"timestamp":1709548167,"seconds_elapsed":18027946,"comment":"we gonna r🦍 you dawg","reply":"gonna rgorilla me dawg? what are you rtalking about dawg","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1347023023,"likes":0,"timestamp":1709548123,"seconds_elapsed":18027990,"comment":"Do you have any headcanons on how Poe got Karl?

I don't interact outside the jpn fandom but when I do, I see many people argue about Mori's character. They say he is a p*do but many of my friends agree he isn't. Though we agree that he likes manipulating children (very bad, I hate groomers). I see them bring his character synopsis as an argument where he says he likes little girls but it does not say anything sexual. It is hard to argue with them because even if Asagiri-sensei says he is not, they would still be doubtful. I think they do not realise that even if bsd is a show for people who is not good at living, ultimately, the show will always catered to the Japanese audience\nI do not mind if fans are not thorough with knowledge about the authors but it would be nice if they had a little more braincells\n(Sorry for any bad English. I am still learning)","reply":"your english is great, please don't apologize. first off, thanks for reaching out despite you not venturing out of the JPN fandom much. second, im not japanese (nor do i speak japanese), but i am specializing in japanese literature for my master's program + i've been in the bsd fandom for a long time, so this is my take on this: i do think bsd mori *is* a pedophile -- or, if you like, he is heavily implied to be *pedophilic,* as in exhibiting sexually perverse behavior involving children. for argument's sake, sure, pedophilic does not *necessarily* mean pedophile (just as having murderous \"behavior\" doesn't necessarily make you a *murderer*), and, yes, its never bluntly \"confirmed\" mori is one. that being said, though, its heavily implied. he calls elise his wife. he makes her look like a young girl on purpose. he teases kouyou at the end of the guild arc that he \"prefers my women under the age of 12\" to which koyou responds \"i'll sew your mouth shut.\" even if this is a casual exchange, it's nevertheless charged with gender-based violence, which you can interpret in many ways. most of the time, mori's pedophilic tendencies *are* played off as comical, but there's that scene in dark era when oda, who we just saw interacting with his orphans (one of them a young girl) walks in on mori and elise \"arguing\" over a dress he wants her to wear (presumably for fetishistic reasons). oda's silence in that scene is very telling to me. additionally, the very visceral ways female characters react to mori like yosano and kyouka are very suggestive. in bonus pieces like the anthology, dazai vaguely accuses mori of inappropriately liking young girls (the translation i read had dazai specifically say \"no way will i work with a loli-con like you again\"). in an omake when fukuzawa asks mori who elise is and he replies \"she's my wife\" there's a gag that has fukuzawa threatening to call the police on him and elise enabling his arrest. there're a bunch of examples in the bsd wan, as well as casual references in tales of the lost and other collaborations. i would say the evidence is too implicit. if it's too difficult to stomach he is a pedophile, at the very least it's undeniable he is *pedophilic.*\n\nanyway, we can talk about this topic for hours. it's interesting, but also tiring. i don't know what you're referring to when you say asagiri says he's not (i would like to see this though, please feel free to show me if you can). i will also say that im no stranger to people like mori, and his \"type\" is the same no matter the background. growing up i had to deal with a lot of older men like him, so, on an emotional level, i understand why people are so hateful towards his character, whether or not there's \"evidence\" to support their idea of him or not. i dont know if this answers your question. maybe i also do not have braincells, but these are my thoughts","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1346269795,"likes":0,"timestamp":1708185760,"seconds_elapsed":19390353,"comment":"How would you rate this movie concept out of 10 and why?\n\nIt's a fantasy-drama film called GARDEN OF WHISPERS.

I don't interact outside the jpn fandom but when I do, I see many people argue about Mori's character. They say he is a p*do but many of my friends agree he isn't. Though we agree that he likes manipulating children (very bad, I hate groomers). I see them bring his character synopsis as an argument where he says he likes little girls but it does not say anything sexual. It is hard to argue with them because even if Asagiri-sensei says he is not, they would still be doubtful. I think they do not realise that even if bsd is a show for people who is not good at living, ultimately, the show will always catered to the Japanese audience\nI do not mind if fans are not thorough with knowledge about the authors but it would be nice if they had a little more braincells\n(Sorry for any bad English. I am still learning)","reply":"your english is great, please don't apologize. first off, thanks for reaching out despite you not venturing out of the JPN fandom much. second, im not japanese (nor do i speak japanese), but i am specializing in japanese literature for my master's program + i've been in the bsd fandom for a long time, so this is my take on this: i do think bsd mori *is* a pedophile -- or, if you like, he is heavily implied to be *pedophilic,* as in exhibiting sexually perverse behavior involving children. for argument's sake, sure, pedophilic does not *necessarily* mean pedophile (just as having murderous \"behavior\" doesn't necessarily make you a *murderer*), and, yes, its never bluntly \"confirmed\" mori is one. that being said, though, its heavily implied. he calls elise his wife. he makes her look like a young girl on purpose. he teases kouyou at the end of the guild arc that he \"prefers my women under the age of 12\" to which koyou responds \"i'll sew your mouth shut.\" even if this is a casual exchange, it's nevertheless charged with gender-based violence, which you can interpret in many ways. most of the time, mori's pedophilic tendencies *are* played off as comical, but there's that scene in dark era when oda, who we just saw interacting with his orphans (one of them a young girl) walks in on mori and elise \"arguing\" over a dress he wants her to wear (presumably for fetishistic reasons). oda's silence in that scene is very telling to me. additionally, the very visceral ways female characters react to mori like yosano and kyouka are very suggestive. in bonus pieces like the anthology, dazai vaguely accuses mori of inappropriately liking young girls (the translation i read had dazai specifically say \"no way will i work with a loli-con like you again\"). in an omake when fukuzawa asks mori who elise is and he replies \"she's my wife\" there's a gag that has fukuzawa threatening to call the police on him and elise enabling his arrest. there're a bunch of examples in the bsd wan, as well as casual references in tales of the lost and other collaborations. i would say the evidence is too implicit. if it's too difficult to stomach he is a pedophile, at the very least it's undeniable he is *pedophilic.*\n\nanyway, we can talk about this topic for hours. it's interesting, but also tiring. i don't know what you're referring to when you say asagiri says he's not (i would like to see this though, please feel free to show me if you can). i will also say that im no stranger to people like mori, and his \"type\" is the same no matter the background. growing up i had to deal with a lot of older men like him, so, on an emotional level, i understand why people are so hateful towards his character, whether or not there's \"evidence\" to support their idea of him or not. i dont know if this answers your question. maybe i also do not have braincells, but these are my thoughts","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1344346355,"likes":0,"timestamp":1706540471,"seconds_elapsed":21035642,"comment":"Eu, tell us how you say Odasaku's name again.","reply":"hehe okay ill post an audio clip under this tweet","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1344203192,"likes":1,"timestamp":1706540173,"seconds_elapsed":21035940,"comment":"I'm sorry but I find it so funny when people hate canon Mori and beast Mori and specifically because he's not a pedophile.

Any tips on what to do to survive grad school?","reply":"congratulations! i dont know what program you got into, but in general some of my tips are:\n\n- accept that you will never know wtf you are doing. nobody else (including your professors) knows wtf they are doing either\n- time management is more crucial now than its ever been before. and by that i dont mean \"all your time has to be dedicated to grad school now,\" i mean the exact opposite. learning how to manage school *and* still have breaks and fun in your life is vital. your health and well-being should always be your priority. even if grad school *is* important, it'll never be the end of the world if you mess up a few times or miss a few deadlines/assignments. you are a PERSON, not a  machine\n- take advantage of all the opportunities/privileges you have. check what resources graduate students have that others dont. network with your professors. make appointments. ask questions. request recommendation letters. apply for jobs. go to events with free meals and snacks (sometimes theres even free booze). you are now part of the academic arena (not just an undergraduate!), so participate in it as much or as little as benefits you. trust me when i say doing the bare minimum in grad school will only bite you in the ass later\n- dont do it alone. being an academic is notoriously one of the loneliest professions ever, but it doesnt have to be so solitary. immerse yourself in the academic community and always learn from others. go to your classes as well as go to any fun events your department has scheduled. graduate school is collaborative, social, and unpredictable, so its really important not to trap yourself within just the four walls of your office. there's so much more to it than the individual work you yourself do\n- communicate with your professors. if youre having an absolutely shitty week, it's better to let them know than not. be as brutally honest as you need. ask for extensions. stay home when youre sick. admit when youre exhausted and just need a break. the staff is meant to help you develop *your* learning experience, and that includes helping to maintain balance in other aspects of your life too. graduate school has more leeway than undergrad, i find, so even if we do push ourselves harder as students, we also have a lot of liberties as well.\n- HAVE FUN !!!

Once again. Unfortunately, I had to take an 8-hour bus and during that journey through hell I was thinking about the answer you gave me last time (I’m the ex-politics major). At this point I feel like I bother you quite a lot but your answers are always exactly what I need to hear, and that’s not how it usually goes for me. So I’m allowing myself to be selfish right here, but I really appreciate what a great introspective person you are. \n\nSo, first of all, I want to know exactly how you knew I’d come to you about my dilemma with literature essay questions being so basic. I have an idea but I’d like to know your thought process? For some reason, I’m curious. In case you don’t remember, this is what you said last time haha: “I 100% knew you’d come to me about this LMFAO” \n\nSecondly, I’m in a tough spot cause I have a lot of essays due. Two of them (the ones I haven’t even started) are fairly easy, but the first one is slowly killing me. It was supposed to be finished by now, but my mind is just not working as it should. The problem is I have to organize the arguments but each argument interconnects heavily with the next to the point that they merge but they are different things at the same time. I don’t even know if I’m making sense right know. It’s a comparative essay about how the audience experiences time and temporality in a Brecht play and a Caryl Churchill one. And the content itself is going great, I’m just redoing the structure of the essay every single day and I have no time for such radical changes at this point. I have no idea how to separate the arguments, maybe I’ve covered way too many things? \n\nAny recommendations without a lot of context, Eunice? \n\nOh, and one last thing. You’re a lifesaver. That’s it, but really, you’re like a far away mentor at this point and I do know I write a lot in these questions and I’m quite the obsessive human being (maybe a tiny bit bothersome from time to time). So thank you!","reply":"hello again! thank you for your kind words, im glad my responses have been helpful. very flattered to be called a mentor, but i like to think im more like a friend. ii dont want you to think im better off or somehow superior bc of one reason or other; im learning just like you are. also, you dont bother me at all; i like receiving messages (thats why i have my inboxes open), it's just i take a while to respond since im so busy. i do try to get to all of them eventually, but ofc im always behind.\n\nanyway, i knew you'd come to your current dilemma because its something everyone in the field has to learn at one point or another. people think studying literature is all about finding new ways to analyze a text or coming up with different interpretations that havent ever been considered before, but its actually all about learning how to write and convey all the new ideas you have to others. thoughts dont mean much unless you express them. thats why a lot of the assignment prompts are \"easy\" or \"basic.\" it may seem obvious or simple to answer, but when you actually try to write down your response and make sense at the same time, you quickly realize how hard it is to do that. i think youre starting to realize that this is the case since you mentioned the struggle of organizing ideas logically. thats very common and i also expected it would happen eventually; it happens to me all the time. you think your idea will need 1500 words of explanation tops but then you realize your topic can actually become a full length novel and that maybe youve taken on too much on your plate. looks can be deceiving; simple isn't always just simple.\n\nthere isnt any magical cure for figuring out the problems we face in writing. the only way through it is by doing it over and over again. we must accept it's a lifelong skill we are constantly developing and that we can never be perfect at it (no one else is either). i definitely recommend making outlines for your papers so you have a roadmap of how you want to structure it. (you can look up how people do their outlines and figure out what works for you). i also think you should read other people's writing to see how *they* organized their thoughts into a compelling argument and learn from them. writing and reading must go hand in hand; you cant improve on one without improving the other. it also important to remember that nobody is expecting you to make this mind boggling epic thesis that throws everything we know about literature out of the water. your teachers want to know what *you* think, so you must prioritize *your* voice and *your* opinion instead of relying on others to say what you want to say for you. it seems like a really simple task, but at the same time, it isn't. not everything you do and submit for grading is going to be your \"best\" work; most of the time, it's better to get it done than to get it perfect. developing a sense of humility is, i would say, a really crucial part of being in academia in general","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1344040909,"likes":0,"timestamp":1706253569,"seconds_elapsed":21322544,"comment":"EU I GOT ACCEPTED TO GRAD SCHOOL","reply":"CONGRATULATIONS !!!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}}],[{"type":"post","post":{"id":1342873724,"likes":0,"timestamp":1706253406,"seconds_elapsed":21322707,"comment":"Hi eu i have a few questions about some book questions  i can’t find a English translation of a book you posted on twitter I think it was Suicidal Narrative in Modern Japan The Case of Dazai Osamu\nALAN WOLFE and have you heard of Lectures on\nDostoevsky\nBy Joseph Frank","reply":"i bought my copy of Suicidal Narrative on Thriftbooks: https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/suicidal-narrative-in-modern-japan-the-case-of-dazai-osamu-studies-of-the-east-asian-institute-columbia-university_alan-stephen-wolfe/1672646/?resultid=654a0be8-ff16-4cd5-a63c-6c02ef11ef19#edition=9417933&idiq=47823843.

Q *is* what dazai used to be. Q *will* become an emotionally complex and compelling adult like everyone's bsd fave is. Q is a living example of whats still *wrong* about the system; they are what dazai, chuuya, yosano, ranpo, etc. left behind when they grew up. no matter how better off they are as individuals, their younger selves are forever damaged. thats why you cant get rid of yumeno or simply overlook them as \"irritating.\" they are the cycle of violence at work. they arent the first and they certainly wont be the last little kid who gets swallowed up by the darkness. their very existence serves as an accusatory finger against the world that failed them and continues to fail them","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1343767341,"likes":0,"timestamp":1706252209,"seconds_elapsed":21323904,"comment":"Approximately how much of your storage is Dazai reaction gifs?

O don't get her character tbh especially her sadism. She was traumatized during the war and grew disgusted of her ability but then, she uses it to dissect  and harm her patients for her own pleasure. This doesn't make sense because she saw people die; their last moments and their loss of sanity through her ability. I doubt anyone who went through the exact same thing as her would become what she is. Maybe it's a coping mechanism but honestly, it makes her backstory look bad no matter how sad it is","reply":"i actually really like yosano's characterization. even though asagiri + harukawa dont touch on her often, i find her authentic and well developed.i guess its bc i relate to yosano a lot, esp her sadistic streak. i know that sounds bad. i dont understand it myself. in my case, i love gore. i love looking at gore and i fantasize about inflicting it to a gross degree. i dont actually *do* anything, but thinking abt it + interacting w it does give me pleasure (to an extent). that doesnt make me any less of a victim or less traumatized. the same can be said for yosano. i understand why she seems strange + hypocritical bc of the issues you brought up. however, do you have to really \"get it\" in order to accept it? ppk tend to have this idea of the \"correct\" way others are meant to react to the things that harmed them, and most of the time this \"correct\" reaction is like \"if you have war trauma you must want to help others,\" and if you instead develop violent PTSD or become meaner, bitterer, or unstable, you're not doing your trauma \"correctly.\" which is ofc ridiculous and its own kind of cruel. you cant control or tell people how they should process the horrible things that happened to them; our hearts arent machines. trauma doesnt always make you kind or heroic or beautiful; most times, it just is what it is in its ugliest, rawest form. it doesn't have to make sense. we can speculate all we want about how \"anyone who went through the exact same thing as her would become what she is,\" but we'll never know, nor should we judge the ways trauma manifests in a person's behavior. it's really complicated.\n\ni also want to say that im not justifying yosano's sadism. ofc its ethically wrong and definitely medical malpractice; but then again, it's fiction. the sadism is mostly played off as dark comedy and a twisted form of female empowerment anyway, so it doesnt really bother me. in many ways, i think her sadism adds to her character's nuance; makes her more human in its contradictions. the \"i went through war but now im a good angelic perfect person who doesnt have any weird coping mechanisms\" narrative is already so overdone, so yosano's quite refreshing, especially, like i said, for someone like me. ultimately, i would say she does more good than harm. even if she takes pleasure in said harm. her abliity makes it that she has to bring ppl to the brink of death anyway, so if she gets a kick out of it, esp bc she knows she cant really kill them and will heal them in spite of all the damage she's inflicting, then thats understandable to me. i've lost count of how many times i wished i could just destroy something bc im so angry, but i dont want to deal with the consequences of breaking said thing. yosano's ability makes it so she doesnt have to do that. she does harm so she can feel good about extinguishing it afterward.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1341962930,"likes":0,"timestamp":1706249842,"seconds_elapsed":21326271,"comment":"\"considering her feelings this deeply shows how much you care\" That's true.

So i don't think we have to feel bad about not having an empowering relationship with our younger selves.\nMaybe even you hating your younger self isn't that much of a bad thing. Maybe it's what she needs? Or just what you need right now, and maybe that's more important. I think hating your younger self is better than being indifferent towards her, because it shows that you've changed and reflected about your past and maybe now you're simply feeling the anger you feel like you should have felt back then. \n\nI remember used to think of myself as a 'monster'. But I don't anymore. Because i understand what little-me went through, so i forgave her and then forgave myself and it doesn't affect me anymore.\nSo i guess, everything starts with just understanding our past selves. \n\nAnyways, we're still young and we have so much left to go through and i'm sure we'll understand ourselves better someday. I'm sure you won't hate the little girl in you forever and that one day you'll be able to acknowledge what she did and at the same grow fond of her. At the very least she made it possible for you to have the will to change and the desire to heal. Your intense feelings towards your younger self might be more of a blessing than a curse, since it just proves how important it is for you to get along with her. It's important to you and that's what really matters. \n\nTalking about this is making me really emotional but i'm positive that whatever comes our way, we'll be able to settle into it. And even if we should never be able to grow out of these relationship dynamics, maybe that's exactly what they need. Maybe the little girl in me just doesn't need to be consoled and maybe the little girl in you just needs to feel these intense emotions. I'm hopeful either way. :)","reply":"i agree that we shouldnt feel bad about not having empowering relationships with any part of ourselves. but hating my younger self to the degree i do *is* technically a bad thing, but i dont waste time dwelling on how awful it is or how awful i am as a person for feeling that way. in many ways i am indifferent towards her. i dont know whether its needed by anyone, or if its anger that deserves to exist, but at the end of the day, it is what it is and there's no changing it much like you said. comparing yourself to other people who seem like they have their shit together is natural, but its important to also remember nobody else really knows wtf theyre doing. nobody is as secure as they appear to be. yes, we're still really young. i think its a lifelong process that just never goes away, for better or for worse. i know i wont feel like this forever. \n\nanyway, yes, i hope forgiveness will come for me and you too. maybe we're both putting too much importance into it, as if when we finally reach a certain point in understanding ourselves, we'll be rewarded or something, which isnt true. your comment about thinking youre a monster made me remember this quote by Miranda July: “Finally, in a low whisper, he said, ‘I think I might be a terrible person.’ For a split second I believed him -- I thought he was about to confess a crime, maybe a murder. Then I realized that we all think we might be terrible people. But we only reveal this before asking someone to love us. It is a kind of undressing.” so, even if you think youre a monster, or even if we are monsters, thats alright. everyone thinks they are. that doesnt mean love can never be there for us to have","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null},"in_response_to":{"id":1341675354,"likes":1,"timestamp":1704065993,"seconds_elapsed":23510120,"comment":"Has your therapist (or someone in general) ever asked you \"what would you say or give to your child-self to console her?\" and you had no answer?\nMy therapist asked me this question and i had no answer.

I'm the ex-politics major who you helped a while ago, here asking for your thoughts once again. I'm loving Literature, really, but this bunch of essays due next month? The problem is that I tend to get bored easily, and when I do get bored it's very easy to be tempted to stay in bed all day and reread Stormbringer and analyse that instead of tackling these very narrow, very uninteresting essay questions. For example, for one of these essays I have to write why Frankenstein is part of the literary canon and I'm like...COME ON. I hope I'm not sounding arrogant here, but they've given us papers explaining why Frankenstein is part of the literary canon, and they want me to use those same papers to explain the exact same thing in 2500 words.  \n\nIn another class, the concepts we've studied (contact zones, nationalism, gender) have been extremely interesting, but I want to take those concepts and apply them to works that aren't in the syllabus. Because the texts we've read from the syllabus are 7-10 page passages whose relationship to the topic of study is obvious. And I don't see the point of examining something that is already obvious. In short, I wanted to innovate, so I wrote to my teachers and they said that, although it was allowed in principle, they did not recommend taking works outside the syllabus. I wanted to write about magical realism's approach to The Anthropocene! It's just...the class material has been so interesting that I feel it is disrespectful to these ideas not to try to challenge and entertain them. \n\nSo, I wanted to ask Eunice, is this normal? To be so drastically bored by essays and no one seems to notice because my French classmates say Frankenstein is boring (BORING)? Or is it that my teachers are right and I'm just an over-enthusiastic first-year who is unconsciously digging her own grave?","reply":"hello! im glad to hear you love literature! no u dont sound arrogant; i 100% knew youd come to me about this LMFAO. yeah, its normal; you learn to embrace it. sometimes even if it seems obvious, there's usually something u miss that u realize along the way. the prompts are meant to be more open-ended and broad so that u can do what y want with it; even if its something basic like \"why is Frankenstein part of the literary canon\" u can still add ur own opinion on it because the essay is trying to judge ur ability to argue something whilst using evidence. so even if the answer is obvious, u have to demonstrate why and thats what ur being graded on. im not exaggerating when i say that every essay i wrote, i already knew the answer, i just had to get the proof i needed + communicate it well enough to earn me a good mark. literature isnt about having the correct opinion, its abt how you can prove that opinion and back it up w facts and evidence. basically, your writing is what counts, not necessarily just your ideas. they can only get you about halfway there.\n\nthat being said, i do get bored very easily too. if i dont find something interesting, i cant do anything with it beyond a surface level analysis. none of my best work was on anything conventional. what i do is contact my teachers and ask them what my options are. i get the same responses from profs telling me its \"inadvisable\" to step outside the neat boxes, but i do it anyway. its always a risk and some might not like it, but if its for the sake of my interest remaining intact for a subject i like, ill take it. so what if i dig my own grave? better to die on something i can get behind than live on something that dulls the brain cells out of me, yknow?","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1341236842,"likes":0,"timestamp":1703419465,"seconds_elapsed":24156648,"comment":"eu I’m applying for grad school, is writing a thesis as bad as I think it is?","reply":"from my experience, nothing is ever as bad as you think it is.

I'm very much a mess, and not only see myself that way. I'm also open about my mistakes, flaws, etc. I'm an open book who isn't afraid of talking about difficult topics.\nI don't have >only< bad things about me. I'm past self-loathing and into self-neutrality, but. I don't do everything right. No one does. Right? I'm a regular person who should be judged as such. In comes the problem.\n\nSee, I'm not good at life. I see beauty in having the right to choose, and enjoy deciding things, after being deprived of it for long. I also love knowledge and am kinda good with words (aka bullshitting lmao). Which makes me look like I know what I'm doing/talking about. People fall for it, even when I tell them it's better not to.\nThey believe I'm some sort of mentor, or “cool, mature person who knows her shit and always does things for a reason”. Or the horror, “she can fix me”. Or they think I'm exaggerating when I mention yknow having flaws, giving me pep talks on “nooo haha don't put yourself down like that, I bet it isn't that bad”. Which leaves me on high alert mode.\nIt WOULD be flattering if not for “you didn't fulfill my expectations, shame on you”. Or “wahh wahh you couldn't fix me”. I'm just some girl who may sometimes help, but isn't fit for nor interested in the “responsible leader-type people fixer” role.\n\nI've started disclosing how I am in advance. In a “neurodivergent girl with trauma, proceed with caution” way. It's not to scare people away. It's an attempt at reinforcing realistic expectations. They do not listen.\nIf there were just tantrums, I'd ignore and move on. Other people's unreasonable expectations shouldn't be my problem, except when they make it be. I've lost count of times when I made mistakes (all people eventually do?), and didn't have a second chance. In most cases, they assume an ill intent from my part. No apologizing that could fix it, no new attempt. My relationship and/or situation will never be the same.\nI find myself in these cases again and again, overthinking all I do, and how I treat the people closest to me. It's especially bad in shared spaces like houses or friend groups. Like I cannot miss, not even once, or else “I will” ruin things. More like “my distorted reputation + people being unreasonable” ruining things.\n\nFor context, I am autistic. Advice much appreciated, or just your thoughts on people being people. Thanks for reading.","reply":"i relate. neuro-minorities like us tend to over-explain why we are the way we are, always \"on high alert\" when somebody criticizes us or makes comments on our \"strange\" mannerisms. whenever i introduce myself to someone i always try to be as communicative as possible abt my situation. sometimes people react positively, but others just flat out reject it, which i can't do anything about. not everyone listens; or even when they think they do, they dont. ill never understand, so i stopped apologizing + self-depreacting as much. i find people are more inclined to forgive their own mistakes than even consider the possibility of them being done by somebody else. we're all so caught up in ourselves in that way we forget everyone's human too. it gets worse when you consider neurotypicals/able-bodied people too. we often feel like we're walking on eggshells, always sparing other people's feelings. it's exhausting, and invites overthinking bc it simply just doesn't make any sense. \n\nso i get it.  \n\nthis isn't revolutionary, but i think you need to learn to be gentler with yourself. your mistakes do not define you, irregardless of what people think. you list some stuff about how youre \"not good at life\" and you dont do \"everything right,\" but youre correct: no one's perfect. you are a regular person, but unfortunately people, no matter how \"regular,\" will always be judged undeservedly. thats how humans are: we think we understand others, when really we're galaxies apart by default. \n\npeople perceive me weirdly too. i don't think it matters -- at least, not as much as our overthinking tells us it does. weird isn't necessarily bad, yknow? im *terrible* at life, but, like you, i like learning things, im good at what i do (idk how), and i do tend to just bullshit my way out of things. fake it till you make it (but i never feel like i make it). im not going around killing people so i think, in general, im not doing that bad. (so who cares if i accidentally break a glass or never go outside of my room?? other people deal drugs mom). \n\ni feel wary when people persistently praise me or insist im somebody im not too. reputations are an opiate. ive realized that i cant change how people see me. tell yourself that over and over until it sticks. i can try to explain or give context, but, at the end of the day, theyre free to have an opinion of me, even if its wrong. i cant control it and thats fine. you are not responsible for the idea of you that people've made up in their minds. you can only be yourself, and the people who mind, don't matter; and the people who matter, don't mind.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1337584894,"likes":0,"timestamp":1701179964,"seconds_elapsed":26396149,"comment":"hi, eu! i was wondering how studying lit has gone for you?

Hope you have a good day","reply":"i havent read anything by kuwabara so unfortunately i cant say much about that.\n\nabout dazai though: im also struggling to to find scholarship on dazai bc of the language barrier. most of the critical work done on dazai thats been translated into english is also mostly written by old white men in the 1970s to 1980s, so thats a bummer. one book comes to mind though: Suicidal Narrative in Modern Japan: The Case of Dazai Osamu (1990) by Alan Stephen Wolfe (again, old and western, but it's got some interesting takes). idk if it touches specifically on abuse/mistreatment, but what i recommend about that is reading scholarship on /other/ texts that have those themes and then /applying/ it to NLH and dazai's writing, which is a good life skill to develop, especially in academia. Junji Ito's interpretation of NLH in his manga of the same name is also a cool read; it's not \"critical\" commentary, but the changes he makes to his adaptation say a lot. Donald Keene is also generally the go-to guy for japanese lit, but im a bit iffy with him bc of his translation choices and lowkey Orientalist takes on, like, everything he \"studies.\"\n\ni hope this helps? im sorry i couldnt do more. i wish you luck on finding content!","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1336032973,"likes":0,"timestamp":1699759706,"seconds_elapsed":27816407,"comment":"Hi Eu! I’m the Politics major who wrote you that long message a while ago regarding my career dilemma…and I cannot begin to thank you because you have no idea how much that answer meant to me. Today I woke up and saw it and you almost made me cry which is a rarity in itself, but I guess the last few weeks have been tough since I’m a semi-functional loner who doesn’t know what she’s doing half of the time. \n\nOn the bright side, I actually requested a transfer to the Lit department and I’m a Comparative Literature major now. I wrote to you already knowing deep down what I wanted to do, but I think I still needed reassurance of some sort, because I realized that I only loved my career because in some way I hated it: I was so resentful towards all those people in my home country who blabber about wanting to study Politics in order to be the next big political figure and finally do a “good job” and I was so resentful towards people inciting hate in the name of ideology. Because the truth of the matter is I’ve always been apolitical in my love for politics. It’s intrinsically linked to people suffering, I just care about that and sometimes I don’t even understand what conditioned me to care so fervently, but the reality is that that’s who I am. Even if I don’t know why, I must choose what’s left in me in spite of myself. \n\nI’ve been more happy in the last few days, attending lit classes. The content doesn’t feel like a burden anymore, but like something I could stay all night reading about because it’s so good. I still don’t want to go to class most of the time, but when I actually get there it’s never that bad. Also! I got a place in the Political Histories of Latin American Culture module even if I had to beg the student support officer to let me in! She was so amused…so that’s the end. Thank you so much for being there, Eu.","reply":"oh im so happy to hear from you and to receive such good news! congratulations on the transfer! and the spot in the political histories module! im very impressed. i hope youre still enjoying your courses and taking good care of yourself. im not going to lie and tell you it'll all be easy and fun, but i could tell from what you sent me that you do really want to do this, so i have no doubt youll be just fine. im glad i could help, you're very welcome, but make sure to thank yourself too bc you did all the work! it's true this world is full of hate and resentment and people using ideology to skew the truth, which is why choosing what makes us happy is an act of revolution in and of itself.  i wish you the best of luck and even more!","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1337389030,"likes":0,"timestamp":1699759286,"seconds_elapsed":27816827,"comment":"I read the whole thing in its entirety and you sound like such a funny person to be around (in a good way ofc) \n\nI'll have your tarot reading ready in a couple of days.\n You don't have to reply to this cc or the official reading but I hope it's accurate for you","reply":"thank u for reading i am a funny person to be around hehe\n\nno rush on the tarot reading! please prioritize urself first","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null},"in_response_to":{"id":1335934275,"likes":0,"timestamp":1699646408,"seconds_elapsed":27929705,"comment":"CC is finally up!

No pressure ❤️","reply":"uwaaah i actually wrote up what happened the day of lmfao here u go (u dont have to read it) (tw // needle mention, blood) : \n\ni got to dentist office and the receptionist made a big deal of me taking out all my wisdom teeth in one go. i was confused and she just laughed nervously bc “its gonna *hurt* i admire you like i could never do that” so i just nodded and went okay. perhaps a bad omen. dentist assistant also told me this was a rly big deal. she kept fussing and asking “are you okay? are you scared?” every 3 minutes and id just give her a thumbs up. she was like “you seem shy and quiet” so i smiled at her to throw her off her rhythm. im sure i creeped her out. i put down “bad pain tolerance” (like a liar) on my forms so theyd give me extra anaesthetic. i ended up getting 10 shots of numbing fluid injected in me it was awesome. i cant feel my entire lower face! she couldve broke my jaw and i wouldve been chill w it. i was awake while they were working so i saw all my blood go through the instruments + on her gloves. she pulled out some crazy tools too like BIG metal forceps, scissors, a drill that made my mouth tingly, and some kinda screwdriver-ish thing she used many times. i asked if i could keep the teeth afterward and they were surprised. they kept praising me like “youre doing so well” “youre doing a fantastic job!” okay but can i keep my bloody teeth (one of them they had to shatter and extract piece by piece bc it wouldnt come out). i think they were disturbed w how quiet and still i was. i only ever said stuff like “thats cool” “hurts” “mhmm” and “what does that do.” the dentist was hesitant to explain the graphics of the tools but i wanted to know so she was like “im using this to drill into your teeth and im anticipating youll need some stitches after this” and i nodded and went “thats cool”\n\noverall an okay experience. im still numbed out but she gave me steroids and painkillers for the pain. i was ordered to rest so ill stay in bed today and read muehehehehehehehe\n\nalso my dentist kept warning me “you might feel pressure” “tell me if it hurts” “youre gonna feel a pinch here” “anticipate a cracking noise” and i was just lying there thinking itd be okay if she broke my jaw or something cause then i can get money and sue the campus dentist.\n\nso yeah thats how it went. as for the tarot reading, sure id like another one!

not weird at all, thanks for reaching out. im based in canada and i dont know much about international programs bc ive never looked into being in one, but i know a few people both in my english department and in general who're at my university through those kinds of programs. a common approach is usually start your undergrad/BA in your home country and then asking yourself the same question about transferring after youve gotten a feel of college life. moving abroad's a really big step and a lot of people end up switching majors or realizing they might not like the path theyve chosen, so thats why im not 100% confidently saying \"yes move out, start a new adventure!\" bc when i first graduated high school i had zero idea what i was doing. if i had moved to a different province like i thought i would, it mightve worked out, but i dont think so. so basically, yes, i think waiting a bit and getting a feel for what you like/dislike in the field(s) you choose is a good idea. there are, however, plenty of people who go abroad immediately, and thats not a bad option either, but its also the more overwhelming one. because it isn't just about school, transport, and feeding yourself anymore it's completely leaving your home and being on your own to find housing, buy groceries, figure out whatever new city you end up in, etc. \n\nfrom my understanding, american universities suck. they're especially unforgiving in terms of student debt and tuition to international students. yes, there's funding, but it's nearly impossible to get a \"full ride\" and i personally think studying at the US is more trouble than its worth. there are a lot of benefits, for sure, but its not a pretty experience. yes there are a lot of good places that have good east asian studies departments, but theyre pricey and the scholarships are as competitive as they come. it's not that much different in canadian universities, ofc, but in general tuition is more affordable here than in the states. i know that the university of british columbia especially has a good program for asian-related studies; i considered moving there for my MA but it never worked out. so i guess id recommend applying to canadian colleges more than US ones (im not a US citizen though, so i dont know how the process works exactly). another alternative you can try is going to a school in north america that *has* studying abroad options. for example, if you come to a uni here and they have an exchange program for studying in japan, then that could be your ticket. its highly recommended you learn the language, yes, but there *are* people whose job it is to help you get settled in if you move for school-related reasons. the language barrier *is* significant though and will affect what courses you get into, so keep that in mind.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

No pressure ❤️","reply":"uwaaah i actually wrote up what happened the day of lmfao here u go (u dont have to read it) (tw // needle mention, blood) : \n\ni got to dentist office and the receptionist made a big deal of me taking out all my wisdom teeth in one go. i was confused and she just laughed nervously bc “its gonna *hurt* i admire you like i could never do that” so i just nodded and went okay. perhaps a bad omen. dentist assistant also told me this was a rly big deal. she kept fussing and asking “are you okay? are you scared?” every 3 minutes and id just give her a thumbs up. she was like “you seem shy and quiet” so i smiled at her to throw her off her rhythm. im sure i creeped her out. i put down “bad pain tolerance” (like a liar) on my forms so theyd give me extra anaesthetic. i ended up getting 10 shots of numbing fluid injected in me it was awesome. i cant feel my entire lower face! she couldve broke my jaw and i wouldve been chill w it. i was awake while they were working so i saw all my blood go through the instruments + on her gloves. she pulled out some crazy tools too like BIG metal forceps, scissors, a drill that made my mouth tingly, and some kinda screwdriver-ish thing she used many times. i asked if i could keep the teeth afterward and they were surprised. they kept praising me like “youre doing so well” “youre doing a fantastic job!” okay but can i keep my bloody teeth (one of them they had to shatter and extract piece by piece bc it wouldnt come out). i think they were disturbed w how quiet and still i was. i only ever said stuff like “thats cool” “hurts” “mhmm” and “what does that do.” the dentist was hesitant to explain the graphics of the tools but i wanted to know so she was like “im using this to drill into your teeth and im anticipating youll need some stitches after this” and i nodded and went “thats cool”\n\noverall an okay experience. im still numbed out but she gave me steroids and painkillers for the pain. i was ordered to rest so ill stay in bed today and read muehehehehehehehe\n\nalso my dentist kept warning me “you might feel pressure” “tell me if it hurts” “youre gonna feel a pinch here” “anticipate a cracking noise” and i was just lying there thinking itd be okay if she broke my jaw or something cause then i can get money and sue the campus dentist.\n\nso yeah thats how it went. as for the tarot reading, sure id like another one! your last one was pretty accurate like immediately after you sent it i had to throw hands w my shitty landlord","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1337210640,"likes":0,"timestamp":1699645553,"seconds_elapsed":27930561,"comment":"These cats are proud of your work\n\n          へ   ♡   ╱|、\n     ૮  -   ՛ )      (`   -  7\n       /   ⁻  ៸|       |、⁻〵\n 乀 (ˍ, ل ل      じしˍ,)ノ","reply":"meow :3","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1335646138,"likes":0,"timestamp":1699645515,"seconds_elapsed":27930599,"comment":"Don't you hate when people ask what you'd do in a zombie apocalypse?

its totally fair for you to need some space or go somewhere else youll feel less stressed. if youre having a panic attack though DEFINITELY WALK OUT. prioritize yourself. panic attacks are *attacks* like asthma or any other physical condition that triggers a big reaction. *prioritize yourself* you arent being dramatic \n•drink water. i always roll my eyes whenever someone reminds me this but yeah it does help. or get someone to fetch you some water if youre unable to at the moment (e.g during a panic attack) \n•eat regularly. im not saying 3 meals a day if u cant do that (I personally cant do that bc of EDs) but try your best to keep your stomach *not* empty. even eating a candy or chips would help you. lack of nourishment and food makes anxiety more likely to flare up and is a good way to avoid panick attacks as much as u can\n•find an outlet to unapologetically vent abt whats making u anxious and frustrated. this could be a friend willing to listen, a social media private account, a journal, your notes app, etc. Most people do tend to need others’ attention and validation though so if ur comfortable enough to talk to someone abt it, pls do that!\n•dont shame yourself if youre stimming or doing something your brain is telling u to do to ease the anxiety. obviously dont continue doing anything if its harming u or others but if you need to keep tapping your foot or shaking your knee or even ugly crying to ease some of the frustration, then do so!","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

The first is Extroverted (E) vs Introverted (I) next is Sensing (S) vs Intuition (N) after that is Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F) and the final section is Judging (J) vs Perceiving (P) The rarest type in the world is INFJ(allegedly).

(I am so sorry for tainting your CC like this but hopefully it lightens your mood or something or maybe you can just laugh at me)\n\nWho is your favorite character from Riverdale and who is your least favorite?\n\nMy favorite is Cheryl. She's erratic, impulsive, and can be kind of a asshole but she's consistent and she knows what she wants. She never really flip flops on her personality and stays the same regardless of the season or timeline. I also enjoy the fact that she's a lesbian and her obsession with Tony at one point was so real. I hated when Tony got with Fangs, it annoyed me so badly, but I'm glad that Cheryl and Tony are together this season. \n\nMy least favorite character is Archie. He's overrated and he gets with literally every single girl. (I'm using literally figuratively because he obviously doesn't get with *literally* every single girl in the series.) He's also a \"mary-sue\" and they try to make him appear flawless which just aggravates me to no end. I hate characters that everyone loves because of their \"perfection\" it ignites a fire in me like no other thing has.\n\nSorry for the silly CC but nobody I know watches Riverdale XD","reply":"youre not tainting my cc with riverdale bc riverdale is the best and more ppl should unironically stan it for its trainwreck dogshit qualities. its like adopting a mangy, hideous cat into your household and loving it anyway, even if it eats its own poop\n\nanyway, WE HAVE THE SAME FAVORITES AND LEAST FAVORITE. i *adore* cheryl blossom shes never done anything wrong her entire life. i love her outfits, her RIDICULOUS morals, and the ABSOLUTELY BONKERS crap that comes out of her mouth. shes iconic, shes smart, and shes so fucking funny for no reason. i love that shes not part of the “main 4” and is honestly just vibing, stirring up chaos most of the time. i find that very relatable and honestly almost noble of her. ever since i saw her in that blue dress in season 1 (?) when her and archie went to the pool and Brooded™️ i fell in love. also i think cheryl shouldve won that dance competition between her and veronica when they first met like i know thats an unpopular opinion but bruh she ate.\n\nas for archie, yeah i fucking hate him hes like every guy i went to high school with who thinks hes hot shit, boy next door innocent, but in reality hes an actual fascist and is generally useless all things considered.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1329124978,"likes":0,"timestamp":1692266594,"seconds_elapsed":35309520,"comment":"Is not having friends a red flag?

For example, someone really dear to me said that there is no such thing as unconditional love. I used to think that to get by, but don’t anymore. If I objected and said “I believe in unconditional love”, they’d ask why, but the truth is the only reason I have is that I prefer the hopeful person, so then I imitate them. But I’m not someone who knows the depth of love, truth, hope, art… I don’t have any convincing speech or story I feel I could change someone’s mind with, especially when they’re in a state trying to survive. Saying I used to feel the way they felt risks seeming condescending and will again lead to a why I can’t answer with conviction. I feel stupid and inexperienced because I think someone wiser than me would know what to say, and I want to be that person but I’m not. I’m stuck with the sensation I am faking and forcing myself to people close to me.  I have to prevent myself from going back to speaking hopelessly because I almost feel like people would trust me and be closer to me more that way. The self benefit tied to hopelessness is so scary. Being told I act more like a child now is so painful, but also true externally and functionally. I’m very lazy and it’s like the only thing I can do now is talk too much of this and that, like someone who feels they’re growing old. and it’s not just a transitionary life phase. Like, when reading books or writing I do fully agree with and believe in my hopefulness and intimacy between people, and I want to be able to bring that to reality without just feeling flattened by everything, even kind comments. I feel weak and double faced to the people who are closest, being more delicate to a piece of paper or anon ask box than towards what I have that’s “real”. There’s so much I can’t say because I don’t have enough answers to try. I don’t want to risk becoming a parent letting down a child with “just because” and breaking senses of dependability. So I just sit dumbfounded at each confession as if I don’t understand because I need to rebuild a framework that I don’t even know if I can’t make without faking it if I want to say something that won’t be brushed off as stupid optimism. Sorry for the silly ask! Selfish but being able to interact makes me feel less insecure. Love ur account","reply":"no need to apologize, you're not being selfish. my biggest question is, do you have to change their mind? shouldn't people respect how others' worldviews have developed instead of trying to convince each other of the \"right\" opinion? would you rather live the truth you want to live or pretend to be someone else for other peoples' sake? you can't force beliefs. the point in having faith in something is that you never 100% know it's real or true, just like how you put your faith in a friend when they enter a contest. you dont /know/ they'll win, but you want to support them. and, yes, there's always the fear of \"what if they lost?\" but equally there's the chance of \"what if they win?\" it's kind of like that/\n\ni agree with you, i do believe there is such a thing as unconditional love. i would hate to explain it to someone who thinks or feels differently though, so what id probably do in that situation is agree to disagree. \"because it's the hopeful answer\" is also a good enough reason to believe in something, so i dont think you need further explanation or any particular miracle anecdotes to justify why you feel that way. it's simply just the truth. you're not trying to be condescending or dismissive; honestly, saying you /used/ to feel that way but dont anymore might be inspiring to someone else who thinks it's not real in order to survive; you cant really change how anyone reacts to something anyway. they're also trying to learn life at the same rate we all are. it doesn't matter that you dont \"know\" the depth of love, truth, hope, art (who does?), what matters if you are in the process of figuring it out (and at the end of the day, we all are). the way you have lived your life has brought you to this particular conclusion, but of course it's not universal. i think in this case being authentic and honest is better than a nebulous \"wisdom\" you fruitlessly pursue. i think you choosing hope is one of the most grown-up decisions you could ever make for yourself; it's not childish, \"delusory,\" \"stupid optimism,\" or unrealistic, it's simply just hope, which is beautiful, and very hard to shrug off once you catch it. i understand feeling this much pressure and feeling insecure, but, from what i can see, you're not being two-faced or \"faking it\" at all. just as your loved ones' experiences and interpretations of said experiences are valid, so are you, and i really think you should be more kind to yourself more than anything by remembering that","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1327523352,"likes":0,"timestamp":1691543299,"seconds_elapsed":36032816,"comment":"personally, I think that Dazai has a cluster-B disorder.

(i mean, it was, but i survived it). i think its valid not wanting to go to the hospital bc it really does disrupt your life but this idea that its a kind of “jail” or punishment is really harmful. honestly, it was kind of nice to be in the psych ward for a little bit bc at that point my reality had become so warped and intensely focused on things going on in my life that i did genuinely need a step back. a part of me wishes id stayed there for longer. in the long run though, ofc it didnt cure anything or make me suddenly change my life. it was a really limbo state kind of 2 weeks. but i guess the seriousness of the entire thing made me realize “oh i am still alive i guess.” idk if this is helpful. im not saying accept the inevitable and just let your therapist admit you to the hospital bc thats not fun. im saying dont think its the end of the world if it does happen. your relationship with your therapist is just like any human relationship in that you need to communicate. make sure they know you do not want to be admitted to a hospital no matter what you say. its vital to let your healthcare workers know what you want out of the treatment. you may just want someone to listen and not do any immediate action. just tell them that. odds are theyll respect your wishes. however, again, as someone whose counsellor did decide i should go, its not the worst thing ever. i think i found a kind of clarity i never knew was possible in there. youll be okay. i know its scary to think about what might happen but no one knows that, yeah? just try your best to be communicative and dont beat yourself up if you dont get the “results” you want. you can also request for a different counsellor if youre REALLY uncomfortable w what youve said to your current one. you have some options, dont worry. its actually a really common fear amongst people in therapy but, even though i partake in the jokes sometimes, i think we all should be mindful that the psych ward is supposed to help you. it isnt a death sentence to end up there and it certainly isnt the end","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1323745372,"likes":0,"timestamp":1688165693,"seconds_elapsed":39410422,"comment":"hi! i hope you’re having a nice day! i’m looking for your advice. i’d like to understand literature better because now my level is “it makes me feel therefore i like it”. is there anything you can recommend?

<3\nWhat is your opinion on Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita?\n--\nHola, ¿cómo estás? <3\n¿cuál es tu opinión sobre Lolita de Vladimir Nabokov?","reply":"hola, lo estoy haciendo bien, gracias :)\n\ni was wondering when someone was going to ask me about lolita. if anybody is really interested in \"modern\" interpretations of lolita, as well as her cultural legacy in writing, i highly recommend listening to Jamie Loftus' podcast about it: https://open.spotify.com/show/4dvc06zTAaAylzdTrsgKzp. the research and commentary are intelligent, nuanced, and bring up good points for discussion. personally, i agree a lot with loftus' points mostly because im finding a ton of anti-intellectualist backlash against the novel and how it should be censored for being problematic and wrong. i am very, very, VERY against any type of book banning and i find it even stupider that people are insisting its erasure would be the \"moral\" thing to do. literature isn't supposed to be moral. i will say also that the book's one of the most misinterpreted. nabokov has stated countless times you're not supposed to like humbert humbert, the protagonist of the plot. it's all told from his perspective but the book opens with a foreword by \"John Ray Jr.,\" who claims to be an editor of psychology books. Ray acts as a middleman between the audience and humbert's \"memoir,\" asking /us/ to basically be like a jury as we read /his/ testimony, so immediately that tells you that the narrator is not only unreliable, but he is mentally unstable, manipulative, and you as the reader /should be critical of him/ from the start. you're not ever meant to \"sympathize\" or \"feel bad\" for this guy bc from the beginning you are /told/ he had recently died of heart disease while awaiting his murder trial in jail. HE HAS ALREADY BEEN REVEALED TO BE THE SCUMBAG HE IS. youre not meant to debate whether or not he is or he isn't bc nabokov is clearly stating he is. instead, the novel's supposed to /show you/ how a predator and a pedophile thinks; that a normal, everyday man in society (humbert was literally just Your Average American Guy) can be so monstrous and disgusting and /still/ think he's the victim. it's a deeply psychoanalytical novel that never justifies humbert but rather studies him /like the psychologist's foreword at the beginning suggests/. i could honestly rant even more abt this book but i read it such a long time ago. i didn't like it, obviously, but nabokov didn't want me to like it and it succeeded in deeply disturbing me. thats what makes it a /good book/.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1323264436,"likes":0,"timestamp":1688159500,"seconds_elapsed":39416615,"comment":"hey eu, have you seen this new 15 dazai figurine that just got announced? got any thoughts? https://twitter.com/dazaiarchives/status/1673443665627467776?s=20","reply":"its cool but personally i would not want fifteen dazai sitting on my noodles. what if he poops on my ramen. no bueno for eu, thats for sure","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1323264239,"likes":0,"timestamp":1688159406,"seconds_elapsed":39416709,"comment":"i was so excited for a moment because i saw that kinokuniya was gonna have asagiri sign bsd stuff,,,,and then i realized it was for the LA location 😭😭 maybe one day,,,,","reply":"pls do not remind me that i wont be there in LA when asagiri comes i am so bereaved bc it shouldve been me ...it shouldve been ME!

However—I believe diminishing another persons interest in two characters is something people shouldn’t do. I have been following you for quite some time now, when I see the odazai art you retweet I just scroll past it and look at the other tweets you post because I really like reading the other things you have to share. Odazai is not technically some kind of scandalous ship—it personally makes me feel a little weird and I as a human being with thoughts am entitled to feel that way however I’m also enough of a human being to understand that just because my opinion is different to another doesn’t mean the opposing opinion needs to be diminished and ridiculed, if someone does or doesn’t like it it’s their problem or lack thereof; it is no problem whatsoever to feel genuine dislike or liking for something as inconsequential thought as a fiction paring of characters /both/ of whom are over the age of 18. If you passionately feasted on the idea that 16-year-old Dazai lustfully making out with 21-year-old Odasaku would be a great idea then sure…there’s the start to a serious issue, and be it an issue that should start with a moment of silence for our lost beloved comrade drifting over to the shores of evil—and end with the block button; having no need to say anything about it other than possibly privately warning the people you are close with on twitter. Lest that fortunately not be the case from what I have seen of their behaviour. Cut the long story short and what I’m saying is that there isn’t any reason for unpleasant discourse on such a realistically infinitesimal subject and people should leave the 23-year-old human being who is with-a-high-honours-and-is-abundantly-more-knowledgeable-than-them-for-many-reasons alone. \n\nAnyway, Eu, there are a few things I remember you’ve said that have rattled me a little and I think I could still disagree with you on multiple random little things, however I still believe you are a good person at heart (satanic-dazai-akin-existence aside) and I truly enjoy reading your analyses wich never fail to be undoubtedly great.","reply":"help me the \"satanic-dazai-akin existence\" did me double damage. thanks for sharing your thoughts. youre right that its really nobody's business what others on the internet do with their interests; so much conflict can just be avoided by following basic netiquette and simply looking away from the things u dont like. i come from a somewhat privileged position bc i know a lot more abt the dynamics of fiction and the legitimate research thats been done on how humans engage with it, so im quite used to people dismissing me or saying im immoral. stories have always been this way and humans have interacted with them relatively the same way they always have; its just with the new digital and social media age that new issues like cyberbullying and online harrassment has really distorted people's literacy rates. its sad, but what can you do, yknow? basically im very liberal to these types of things. im not asking everyone to agree with me, thatd be too ridiculous. i am not so arrogant to believe what i interpret is ultimately \"correct\" and ive never felt the urge to harrass someone over their relatively harmless opinions on fiction.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1321339195,"likes":0,"timestamp":1686901100,"seconds_elapsed":40675015,"comment":"hello Eu can i ask how do you bullet-journal? i’ve attempted few times but never managed to stick to it.

(its so expensive too! waaah!). ive been bulletjournalling for about 5 years now and i go for a more scrapbook or doodling aesthetic bc its less work and feels more comfortable to me. it depends on the person ofc but a big thing i genuinely had to accept was that i needed to stop comparing myself to others and just have fun bc its supposed to be fun and stress-relieving. i also dont bulletjournal every single minute like a lot of ppl do; if im too busy some weeks i just dont touch it or i make weekly spreads in advance. if i dont want to make a habit tracker for the month, then i dont. very rarely do i reflect and journal in my bujo since i see it as more of a planner or agenda, but people certainly do and its helpful. basically, you figure it out as you go and find out what works for you. theres no wrong way to do it! i see bulletjournalling as both a way to express yourself creatively and also a way to organize your life; so if those needs arent being met and i find myself more stressed out than not, then i stop myself bc why am i overthinkingso much, yknow? (like, what if the markers im using are the wrong ones bc i got them from the dollar store? 😥 do i have ugly looking stickers even though i think theyre cute? and whats all this about MEASUREMENTS i just draw and hope for the best i cant do math for my bujo 😭).

(u can ask ur school if there're any student benefits for that specifically; for example, my university tuition allows me \"free\" bus rides anywhere i go during the semesters i work in bc im a student). as for other jobs, its really up to you (students have a pretty decent employment acceptance rate), but i *highly advise* to be careful since students are very vulnerable and often get abused by their superiors. try to get a job on your university campus or near where you live so you dont have to spend so much time commuting and stressing over making it to class on time or being late for work. i myself had a part-time tutoring job at my uni library and a lot of my friends are either in retail or service jobs close by the campus (though those are very difficult, so again, please keep yourself safe). if youre in graduate school im assuming you also have a BA/undergrad which can already get you a lot of places. if you think u can do it, u can definitely sign up for a full-time or high-paying part-time job bc you have a degree. i know people who are high school teachers, gym trainers, PARENTS, small business owners, service workers, etc doing their MA. there are definitely a lot of options but please do not overexert yourself. school can get very overwhelming as it is so if you need financial help to afford everything, /go tell someone/ and see what u can do. there're some supports for financially struggling students in and outside universities. theyre a pain to look through but from my experience they do want to try and help, it's just a headache getting money any way you go about it. i hope this helps. welcome to canada and good luck w everything!","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1321416375,"likes":0,"timestamp":1686898695,"seconds_elapsed":40677420,"comment":"Beast odazai drives me feral.

Shakespeare’s actually more accessible than people think. use sparknotes, use your local library, use wikipedia, use crash course videos, use TedEd, use no fear shakespeare. literally all Shakespearean scholars depend on each other to figure out wtf hes even saying so dont be ashamed to look for guidance and help from others!

you mentioned few times that it was hell for you but what about stuff like grades? because from the way you write and the fact you graduated with high honours i would assume you were getting really good grades despite not doing well mentally (hope that doesn’t sound rude im genuinely wondering :)  )","reply":"i was a brown immigrant kid from a low-income family who got into a rich private lutheran high school by scholarship (and i barely got the scholarship). i didnt know it back then but the people i had classes with were living in a completely different world from me (i had a classmate whose parents commissioned the construction of a $10 MILLION mansion; the house had an arcade, theater, pool, squash court, over 11 bathrooms, a fully functional bar, gym, and over 80 rooms). meanwhile i considered buying myself a $4 iced coffee a luxury. i was really all by myself. nobody was 'like' me in terms of background bc of the class distinction. nobody was willing to admit it either.\n\naround grade 10 my mental health tanked. my home life was emotionally (sometimes violently) abusive, my family and i didnt have much money, both my parents had depression, my sister was working a part-time job, my best friend was suicidal, and i was doing homework for over 6 hours a day, pulling all-nighters, starving myself, and never leaving my house. there was so much going on.\n\nwhat made the whole thing the absolute nightmare that it was though, was that my high school never believed i was in pain. they didnt believe me and saw me as subhuman bc of my class, race, and general background. all the staff members were well-off, able-bodied, neurotypical, white, cishet Christians who would tell me horrible, horrible things whenever i tried to ask for help. i cried everyday for 2 years. i still cant remember most of it. it genuinely was hell. \n\nsurprisingly, i did decently in terms of grades. i didnt have the energy for a job, extra-curriculars, or clubs, but i kept my head above water + graduated with everyone else. i was considered a \"smart kid,\" but behind all my good grades and successful projects i was just overworked, miserable, and killing myself. i never failed a class. i showed up as much as i could. even after i came home from the hospital, i didnt make a fuss about having to take my midterms the day i got back. nobody was helping me. my high school made it very clear they thought i was exaggerating, that i was lazy, that i was lying bc \"everyone else is fine.\" they knew i was suffering. they gaslit me into thinking it wasn't as bad as it was.\n\ni often got the line \"your grades are good, so why are you complaining? ur being unreasonable,\" so even if my marks were alright, ultimately they used it against me. all my hard work, and they used it to keep hurting me.\n\nit was hell. i was a kid.\n\nwhen i left that place and went to university things got infinitely better. i still struggle with school (the education system is not built for people like me), but its nothing compared to back then. thank god.\n\nplease dont feel bad for me/feel the need to comfort me abt this. i appreciate it but i dont like pity. i dont mind answering, its just hard to put into words if that makes sense.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1321151548,"likes":0,"timestamp":1686545406,"seconds_elapsed":41030709,"comment":"What are your favorite literature translators, if you have any?

nothing's set in stone. we may think publishing something online or submitting a test is \"the last chance\" we get so it /has/ to be perfect, but thats not true. you can always try again, and you'll soon realize u /dont/ even wanna try again, so why would you try so hard the first time?

Meiji era started in 1868 and ended in 1912, so it's more like from late 19th to early 20th century. On top of that, while Akutagawa was born during Meiji era, his writer career started in Taisho era (which covered years 1912-1926, coincidentally the years when he was in his early 20s to late his life, as his suicide followed in 1927). Higuchi is one of the Meiji writers for sure, as her life and career took place during it, and she passed away before the 20th century even started. In other words, they are two different generation writers. With BSD you are free to go wild with ideas as that's the whole point of the series, Asagiri never intended to be historically accurate with the characters. But please be careful with what you say, we don't need more incorrect information to circle around in this fandom.

Go read facts (preferably in Japanese) and not NLH, which is half-fiction. I'm by no means a fan of him, more like I actually lowkey dislike him because he is overrated. And BSD fandom is so unhinged I came to dislike him even more than I had before the series existed. But I have had to study him quite a bit through years and I have a friend who has writted a lot about him. But to the facts: Dazaivs wife CHEATED on him, she wasn't assaulted. Dazai had been hospitalized while that happened and you can imagine how heartbroken he was (go read his mentors' and close friends' testimonies about this), thinking that the love of his life would be there waiting for him while he tries to get to clear coast with his drug addiction... Only to learn that she hadn't been faithful. Why did he write the exact opposite in NLH is probably because he was in denial that his wife would choose another man over him, so he made the other guy the bad guy (which he partially was actually, but Dazai's wife also was in fault). But he's by no means a misogynist. A guy wouldn't write good female protagonists that get praise even these days if he was a guy like that. Go ask any Japanese scholar of his and they would praise him for his female characters. The description of a prostitute in NLH didn't mean he hates women; he found THE PROSTITUTES pitiful for not having will of their own, they were forced to accept paying customers like hkm. He described them as \"lunatics\" for this very reason that \"normal\" women would have questioned his acts and sanity, they would be proper women possibly with a family. Prostitutes were like dolls back then, just go read any Japanese history book about this and you will realize how a modern day person's image of a prostitute is very different, even more different than what Western vs. Japan was like. But like Dazai continues in NLH, he found comfort from the prostitutes, because they were like him; trash of the society (many of these poor women didn't have good grasp of regular human life just like he didn't either). They were in the same boat. If this is misogyny, then what the hell is with other guys who are also characters in BSD. Some of them conducted actual domestic violence on their families, unlike Dazai. If anything, he was just a bad husband because he had relationships with other women while being married, but then again it was and is still very common in Japan. But he was a very, VERY loving father. If anon wants to call him out for something, then hate him for having multiple women. Stop with the misogyny, that's a big lie and this comes from a person who dislikes the guy for other reasons. A misogynist would never touch a woman or have multiple ones of them. Also Eu, don't answer shitty anons who are harassing you. They don't deserve anyone's attention.","reply":"you didnt have to go this hard but i am very grateful you went this hard cheers 🥂 to the stray dogs","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1315499252,"likes":0,"timestamp":1682917767,"seconds_elapsed":44658349,"comment":"aliexpress anon here, yes i'll let you know when i get them ♡ also, forget those mean anons eu, i always learn something when i read your analysis, keep it up!","reply":"💙💙🙏🏽 i look forward to seeing the mochis hehe 🥰🥰 (thank you as well)","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1315479642,"likes":0,"timestamp":1682885152,"seconds_elapsed":44690964,"comment":"so sorry ur getting so much hate .. ive sent some asks very rarely (particularly about literature) because mostly when i first saw your account it was the first time i was struck w the feeling of \"this person actually gets it!!\" and that still hasnt gone away. keep it up !! i love what u do C:","reply":"thank u so much i genuinely appreciate it 🙏🏽🙏🏽  at the end of the day thats why im still here even despite all the constant and unnecessary harrassment. please keep those asks coming or even if u just wanna send me some lit thoughts they genuinely make my day","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1315467921,"likes":0,"timestamp":1682884993,"seconds_elapsed":44691123,"comment":"Hi i'm the aliexpress mochi anon, thank you so much eu!!

Do you think that’s related to dazai and fyodor’s relationship in bsd?","reply":"i think how people conceive “sin” as a concept in general as a universal given when really, depending on your background, you could have a totally different view of it altogether because of social, political, cultural, religious, etc differences. dostoyevsky’s operating from a eurocentric, (orthodox) christian view of sin wherein he sees something as inherently sinful (ability users) and holds its erasure above everything else for the sake of correcting that sin. dazai, who doesnt come from a western or christian background (although the west + christianity’s influence on japan and the eastern world is unavoidable), sees sin without the heavy religious extremism. i think Dazais understanding of sin still is affected by common, surface-level understanding of what sin *is* (he knows the difference between good and bad), but he differs from dostoyevsky in that he does not feel its his right to judge nor enact punishment to the crimes humans committ against god. their dynamic is fascinating bc theyre supposed to be cut from the same cloth in terms of having the same intellect and tendency to analyze situations, but at the end of the day they are fundamentally two different people /because they do not share beliefs/, which pretty much disentagles all similarities they have w each other bc it shapes who they are as human beings to their core. even if they may be almost identical in terms of erudition and perhaps even social outcasting, fyodor is fixated on crime, punishment, God, and correction, whereas dazai is no longer human and is therefore more focused on deconstructing humanity at its rawest form, without much censure or castigation. yeah basically fyodor christian + western understanding of sin vs dazai pragmatic + eastern understanding of sin.\n\n^^ also not implying that eastern religions and belief systems have zero or a “lesser” concept of sin btw. its vastly complex and i dont have time (or the personal knowledge) to get into it but i just wanted to emphasize that people’s concept of sin /isnt/ set in stone and, from person to person, it can either be very fluid (like with dazai) or hardset (like dostoyevsky).","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1312503288,"likes":0,"timestamp":1681058712,"seconds_elapsed":46517404,"comment":"https://twitter.com/r1kuuw/status/1645042901557342209?s=46&t=_R8iRpg-i8Re1qlru-9-Ig this just reminded me of that CIHY scene hehe","reply":"im sorry, do u mean You Havent Changed a Bit, Chuuya?

everyone around me tells me not to do it because it doesn’t pay, it’s easy and anyone could do it, i’d have a worthless degree etc. english/lit as a major is looked down on where i’m from ig. but i do genuinely get really excited about literary analysis, character depth, creative writing etc. i’m happy in english classes. but i do admittedly care about things like money and status too. what would you recommend? do you think your life is stable as a lit graduate? sorry for dumping this on you i just look up to lit majors and wanted answers from them ;_; all of my friends are in stem bro","reply":"changing majors like this is totally normal; you're not \"lost,\" you're just figuring stuff out, so don't fret. yes, id recommend english as a major but it isn't for everyone. you won't become a millionaire once you get the degree (although you might, who knows), but the longer i spend in this world the more i realize that people who have the most money or the most successful careers tend to be really fucking miserable and empty inside. like so many people who make 6 figures dont have a smidgeon of meaning in their lives. like wow maybe you should read the great gatsby by f. scott fitzgerald and maybe calm down a little; money isn't everything and we've literally known that for centuries, you just got brainwashed by capitalism so bad that you think humanities don't matter despite being /humanities/. something i hear often is \"well if the apocalypse happens no one's gonna hire an English major but the world will always need doctors.\" yeah. sure. when the world ends all the employment agencies will still have those fat wads of cash to pay you while you fight off zombies with your Microsoft Excel charts. the world needs doctors as much as the world needs hope. full offence to the people who told you this but not everyone can do it lol. im not gonna lie to you and tell you it's easy. everything worth doing is hard, not just science and math. nevertheless, i know just how much a humanities major's looked down on in most places. im in Canada so there're opportunities for me and my major that people from other regions in the world might not have, so that's important to keep in mind. but nothing in life's guaranteed. becoming a doctor or an engineer isn't an automatic highway to success and fortune (yknow how likely you are to get sued in those fields? im certainly able to sleep better knowing i have virtually zero chance of putting someone's life at risk. not everyone can handle that kind of responsibility/pressure. and not everyone wants to. that shit's crazy). so despite what everyone thinks, no, stem =/= success. i would even say the extremes between success and failure in stem are way more unbalanced, or at the very least hard to predict. nothing's stable, sorry to say. \n\ni want you to know this just in case no one's ever said it to you yet: your happiness is what's most important. you're the only one you've got. no one else is going to live your life or do your job or get your education for you. so be kind to yourself. let yourself make mistakes trying to find out what you really want. i promise -- i /promise/ you that being happy's more important than money or status. i know it may seem like they're so big and important now because you're in your first year and nothing makes sense, but that feeling's never going to stop no matter how old you get. the world and life are always going to be scary, unpredictable, and tough. might as well have as much fun as you can. and if fun means doing literature, then do it. fuck em all, so long as you're happy","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1312295727,"likes":0,"timestamp":1680927325,"seconds_elapsed":46648791,"comment":"Hello Eu!

So, when it comes to Clarice its kinda hard to pinpoint exactly what she writes about. She doesnt really “fit” into any specific School or style because her work is very unique, tho her writing took place during the 3rd phase of the brazilian modernist movement and therefore she can be perceived as modernist herself. Her stories focus especially on the psychology of her characters (mostly of the main character tho) and most part of the time they dont have an emphasis on plot, but on the way things are portrayed and on deep “philosophical” analysis, so her literature can be interpreted as “intimist literature” (idk if thats how you say it in english akjsdkasjdk, if it doesnt make sense and you wanna look it up in portuguese its “literatura intimista”). I’ve had many teachers tell me: “Clarice’s work is not something you understand, it’s something you feel.” And that used to annoy me a bit but now i agree with it almost entirely, everything she does is SO profound and whenever i read her i’m always in awe, i recommend her extremely, she is considered one of the greatest brazilian writers, and rightfully so.\n  One of her books that i own mentioned this New York Times review talking about her book \"The Chandelier\": https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/books/review-chandelier-clarice-lispector.html   I'm not really the best at reviews ksjdksjd so if you want to see an english speaker talking about her this review maght be a nice read.\n  (I was gonna answer you on twitter but i saw my answer would be HUGE kajdksa so i decided maybe it'd be better to do it here. Anyways, glad to be able to talk about Clarice and how amazing she is to other people!!

\ni’m an english major myself but my lit courses are very limited (bc i also study linguistics and translation), basically in those courses, i’m spoon-fed, i don’t have much room to come up with my own interpretations and analyze the works i’m studying and it’s been affecting me negatively since i personally like literature and analysis. i do believe that interpretation is very much subjective and not really something that can be taught, i also think it’s a personal problem since i have trouble forming an opinion myself lol, but if possible, can you share tips or advice on how i can be better at interpreting works? thank you very much^^!","reply":"🥺🥺🥺 ohhh thank youuu. ive actually been feeling pretty down lately so this cheered me up a bit, i am grateful. please dont feel the need to read everything but im still highly honored. i hope youre having a good day/night as well!\n\nidk how you do it i did my absolute most to avoid taking linguistics bc it just goes way over my head. im sorry to hear its affecting you negatively; i would probably be the same if i was in your situation. but analyzing lit doesn't just have to be done in an academic context! i think you actually get better at interpretation when you just let yourself think about something without worrying about forming an opinion or setting a hard thesis. like, just read a book or watch a movie and sit with how it made you feel + think abt what you liked/disliked/are confused from it. i think the best advice is to not underestimate yourself and your ability to pick up on things. just bc u cant exactly put it into words or fully explain it, you're still engaging with the work no matter what. and i also suggest learning from other people! look up what people have to say about books + how they interpret it (like even looking up a quick book review on YouTube or reading a news article talking about which 10 books you should read if you wanna get into Victorian literature, etc.) and see how they argue why, and then check w yourself to see if you agree or disagree. honestly don't isolate yourself thinking you're gonna be able to just figure it out on your own -- it's way less fun that way; listen to what other people have to say and you'll also find yourself thinking abt these things naturally.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

I've gone through a ton of healthworkers since then (i joke that my \"body count\" isn't the number of people i've slept with, it's actually the number of therapists and counsellors I've breezed through in the past few years. i think the number is ........... 12? 13? therapists + psychologists, 5 counsellors, 4 psychiatrists, 1 nutritionist, 1 dietician, several miscellaneous doctors, etc. I've honestly lost count). I've also been on medications about the same time length too.\n\nim not gonna lie, most of the time it's a bitch. i /completely/ understand getting tired of it and quitting midway, so no judgement on that. overall id say it's positively impacted my life (i mean, im still alive and can kinda function. not spending everyday crying in bed now, so thats a win i suppose). yet, when im actually sitting in the session room and trying to voice whats wrong (and failing lol), or my doctor hands me another requisition to do labwork, or i have to stand in line at the hospital again bc idk why i feel a certain way, it all just feels like dogshit. the (mental) healthcare system sucks, and thats coming from someone who lives in Canada, which supposedly has one of the best healthcare programs in the world. it's a double-edged sword, even though on the whole it's definitely helped. the analogy i use is that it's like chemo-therapy. nobody denies it's hell to go through, but, at the same time, it's supposed to help you from what's making you sick. its not like a broken arm or heart replacement surgery. it's cancer, and cancer /sucks/ to treat. one of the biggest setbacks people have w therapy is expecting too much from it, i find. thats why now i always come in with the lowest standards when i have to meet w a new therapist or go on a new medication thats supposed to make all the pain go away hooraaay. the point is to keep trying. its really tiring, but eventually something will work for you. eventually something'll stick and there'll be those precious moments when everything doesn't feel so miserable as it used to bc you decided to try out journalling or you go on morning walks now or you finally got a new prescription with no bad side effects. like i said, this is a hard thing to (constantly) deal with, and i dont blame anyone who just wants out. i guess my case is different since i /know/ my illnesses/conditions are chronic and they'll never go away, so i have to keep trying -- not with an end-goal of being \"cured,\" but just with the hope it might get easier. and, from my experience, it does. even if you don't want it to, it does. i promise.\n\ni promise.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1308225082,"likes":0,"timestamp":1677719530,"seconds_elapsed":49856586,"comment":"What's your personal experience like in the bsd fandom?

(that's just how it is). as someone who's read bsd since chapter 1, its a really fun experience, but ofc dont pressure yourself to read *everything* since it is kind of long (or maybe its not too long for you i know people who can read manga with like 100+ volumes + bonus material). i also think if you read the manga you'd see the anime in a different light and appreciate bsd overall.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1307106987,"likes":0,"timestamp":1676749221,"seconds_elapsed":50826896,"comment":"Just dropping by to say that it's skk fluff week! ❤","reply":"that is wonderful but i have no fluff to give 😞 all i am is pain and crack, im afraid","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1307161256,"likes":0,"timestamp":1676749153,"seconds_elapsed":50826964,"comment":"thoughts on absurdism?","reply":"at a point in my life when i think absurdism and realism are the same thing like what is even going on man","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}}],[{"type":"post","post":{"id":1307066695,"likes":0,"timestamp":1676749109,"seconds_elapsed":50827008,"comment":"what kind of teaching do you do? obviously literature, but what age demographic or whatever? /gq and do you enjoy it?","reply":"im not actually a full-on teacher, but im a teaching assistant for a 100-level university english class. my students are mostly in the eighteen to twenty range since it's a \"freshman\" course, with the former being the most common. i do really enjoy it! i dont think i could ever become a fulltime teacher or professor but i really like seeing people engage with literature from all walks of life, it reminds me why i love stories so much.

\n\ni come from a very catholic upbringing and for a majority of my teenage years when i started realizing how much it hurt me, i got to a point where i was a little disillusioned with faith, but now my 'spiritual' perspective isn't necessarily hindered by hard, straight dogma like the catholic church had me believe when i was younger. on paper im still identified as a catholic (if im not, my family will actually behead me), but i most definitely dont subscribe to everything. that's not exactly \"picking and choosing\" either, it's figuring out for yourself as a human being on this planet what makes sense, what has value, and what is just human folly (i.e. i like some catholic ideas, such as giving to poor/needy and loving thy neighbor and whatnot, but i /don't/ like how heavily involved the catholic church is in pedophilia, sexual assault, anti-abortion laws, etc. that stuff, in my eyes, are things humans made up either bc of misinterpretation or bad intentions; it isn't \"God's fault,\" if that makes sense). even so, i don't have all the answers, obviously. i think spirituality and faith are things people grapple with every day, even in tiny increments, and it's normal to have issues and sometimes even frustrations with it. that in itself is a testament to how important it can be to you. we're meant to question what we're told and accept what doesn't add up and reject was doesn't. being able to make that decision for yourself with no outside pressures or obligations is your fundamental right as a human being existing in this crazy universe nobody knows all the answers for. your meaning is /your/ meaning","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1306750517,"likes":0,"timestamp":1676348868,"seconds_elapsed":51227249,"comment":"do you have a least favorite bsd character, besides the obvious ones like mori or fukuchi?","reply":"dazai.\n\njkjk. i don't like a lot of the white people lol. keep in mind it takes /a lot/ for me to actually hate a character since i think most of them are interesting/have potential, so this is just my personal tastes. i don't like john steinbeck; i think he's a hypocrite, his ability's so crude, and what he did to yumeno is unforgivable. i'm hesitant to say i don't like fitzgerald either bc on one hand i understand his importance to bsd as a whole and IRL fitzgerald *is* one of my favorite authors, but on the other hand he was just willing to incinerate all of Yokohama (Hiroshima and Nagasaki-style) just to fulfill his own selfish whims; he also represents pretty much everything i hate about north America, especially capitalism, nepotism, white privilege, etc. i think now that fitzgerald's kind of just There in the manga and he's not actively doing anything, im more okay towards him; but yeah that \"burn the whole city down\" thing, i can't forget. this is also a big reason why i don't like louisa may alcott. yes, i can feel sorry for her being submissive and powerless, but at the end of the day it was she who came up with the incineration plan to begin with and enabled fitzgerald to go through with it; even if she showed a little bit of guilt or hesitation, her lack of any kind of moral backbone and complete blind trust in fitzgerald rubs me the wrong way. most of the fandom sees her as a \"little woman,\" as in oh poor girl, poor louisa, not having any agency or power in life, but she literally does. she's not dumb or misinformed either. she was quite literally fine with committing mass genocide with the guild and never said a word against it. i dont like that!\n\ni also dont vibe with Margaret Mitchell lol. i like her with Nathaniel but as an individual, she gives me bad vibes. her *entire* aesthetic is the southern belle, antebellum type because of Gone With the Wind AKA when slavery and segregation were at their fucking peak; it doesn't help that in GWTW, the anti-black racism is just ... so gross.

A lot of \"mature\" media I see with a masc target audience or masc thematic tropes that tries to comment on the \"woes of masculinity\" frames it with a \"see women men have problems too, you just wouldnt understand\" type of way? (mostly in regards to modern media) either that or it's not the central theme or very nuanced about it. or its a work that comes off as self pitying. I hope that makes sense. idk if classic lit is even a good place to search for gender deconstructions or is it better to turn to modern lit since it can more directly discuss it? \nI'm also wondering if you have media recs that cover or include good examples of\n- drastic, repetitive attention seeking behavior (not in relation to romantic relationships)\n- isolation from unrealistic obsession over violent impulse or spreadable sickness\n- factitious disorder\nI hope none of its too specific. I love ur account btw rarrarara","reply":"hmmmm this is a difficult ask, but i'll try my best to give a good answer. since i know most about books im afraid they're going to be the main kind of \"media\" i'll be mentioning here. that being said, if you take most works from the angle of gender, misogyny, femininity, masculinity, sexism etc., you can probably yield a good analysis. like im thinking of literally all of shakespeare's plays that have women in them; if you focus on just the female characters you can go to town, especially in works where he *wants* you to compare the realm of men to women's like hamlet, romeo & Juliet, antony & cleopatra, twelfth night, etc.\n\nas for toxic masculinity, pretty much any \"classic\" book you can think of fits the bill. im not an expert on modern literature but i know there's still toxic masculinity in them; so long as men think they can write and deserve sympathy for being men, there's always going to be that kind of crap in books. the one that comes to mind is Lord of the Flies by William Goulding (you can do A LOOOT with military and toxic masculinity there), any war-related work by Ernest Hemingway (he had many issues), and War & Peace by Leo Tolstoy. The Kite Runner and/or A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini are also great. Like I said, if you specifically want to focus on something from a gender lens, most works will yield you good results. \n\nas for your other asks:\n-drastic, repetitive attention seeking behavior: check out shirley jackson. also anything lord byron's written bc he's an attention seeking whore (derogative). vladimir nabokov is also hella crazy.\n-isolation: alexandre dumas, (again) shirley jackson, the Brontë Sisters, Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Virginia Woolf, DOSTOYEVSKY, charlotte perkins-gilman, yukio mishima\n-factitious disorder: this one's tricky bc its difficult to tell, but examples i can think of is Hamlet trying to pretend he's crazy, atonement by ian mcewan, and maaaaybe The Phantom of the Opera (?)","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1306526305,"likes":0,"timestamp":1676183972,"seconds_elapsed":51392145,"comment":"Hey!

And also some comments made by naomi before lucy trapped her and she was talking with tanizaki about something she made him do the night before like what??\n\nSorry if it doesnt make any sense, english is not my first language","reply":"bsd-bibliophile has a great explanation of it in relation to IRL tanizaki's book Naomi, which you can read here: https://bsd-bibliophile.tumblr.com/post/171775901850/sorry-to-put-in-two-asks-in-a-row-but-there-was. \n\nbasically, their relationship is canonically biological siblings in the series, with naomi being the younger of the two. (although the theory that they're not actually family is quite sound; all the bsd material I've seen presents them as biological siblings). in the book, a similar 'familial' relationship between the main character and a woman named naomi happens, though they claim they're distant relatives/cousins, not brother and sister, to everyone outside of their affair/sexual relationship. another reason for tanizaki and naomi's weird relationship in bsd is because IRL tanizaki was pretty freaky with sex and women. you can look up how he had a complicated relationship with his wife and the standards by which society judged \"successful\" marriages during his time. bsd-bibliophile also makes great explanation of it, but i essentially think bsd tanizaki siblings are a (weird) nod to how tanizaki had a (wild) sexual relationship with his sister-in-law, who he viewed as the “ideal woman” and was also the model for Naomi in his novel. to say tanizaki's kinks and ideas of sex, bdsm, fetishes, etc. was extraordinary is a bit of an understatement, so that's the reason why the bsd tanizaki siblings appear to be really touchy/sexual. so yeah. on one hand i can kind of understand the literary allusion, but it's mostly just weird to include and i dont know what to make of it. individually, i like junichirou and naomi as characters but when they're together it just starts alarm bells in my head.\n\ni hope this is a good answer. and thank you for asking, don't worry your english is perfect!","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1306006384,"likes":0,"timestamp":1675644366,"seconds_elapsed":51931751,"comment":"hello! idk if you'll even see this bc cc decided to live again but ANYWAYS.

I've tried so hard to fix this + read more during the day, but at this point im just grateful i found at least *some way* i can focus on reading even if the time isn't as ideal. so my advice is to try things out and see what works for you. dont get discouraged if you cant read on certain days (or even for certain weeks!). it's a really, really fast-paced world and, if you can help it, reading should be enjoyable for you, so you can make it your own through trial and error","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1305704013,"likes":0,"timestamp":1674620283,"seconds_elapsed":52955834,"comment":"Oda was 23 when dazai was 22????

A few days ago you were addressing that one analysis post about Untold Origins, and you mentioned the angel/religious symbolism all throughout BSD and said that it will get more intense as the series goes on; can you elaborate a little on your thoughts about that? I don't really know much about Asagiri, but I've noticed all the religious symbolism/imagery too (I mean, obviously it's impossible to miss it at this point), and it makes me wonder how religious of a person he is... I personally have a theory that the strongest (but perhaps not as in-your-face) religious symbolism revolves around Oda and his role in the narrative: he has a hand in so many people's fates and is in many ways the origin of the story, and he died for his sins so that people after him could thrive, not to mention the explicit references to Christianity made with him, with the bible passage he and Gide quote, and the /two/ instances now where new adaptations have gone out of their way to give him a bible and drawn attention to it when he didn't have one in the original source materials. I don't want Oda to come back to life or anything, but I really can't help but feel like he's the Jesus figure or at least an angel figure in BSD (...and I've been calling him Dazai's guardian angel for years now, it's been my tumblr url for all this time; I'll feel so vindicated if this ends up being confirmed in some way 🥹)..... but I'm rambling alsdfjgfkdsla, regardless, the religious/Christian/angel symbolism in BSD is very interesting to me now. I didn't really think much about it in the manga until I read Untold Origins, but UO makes it blatant -- I'm certain we'll continue to see more of it, I just don't know how, but I'm excited to see.\n\n(also side note but the whole thing of \"I thought everyone knew this; was all this really not obvious to everyone else? Am I just the crazy one?\", MAN I feel that ALL THE TIME with bsd and reading some things in the fandom 💀🤡 Truly embodying teenage Ranpo there, I guess, having to explain things I just thought went without saying to anyone with eyes and basic reading comprehension 💀💀💀)","reply":"well the religious symbolism and straight-up lines alluding to religious themes are hard to miss. the easiest one i can remember is that line in dead apple when shibusawa was asked \"who will save you? an angel? or a demon?\" there's also the dynamic between Nathaniel Hawthorne and fyodor, who are both religious yet ironically do not view it the same way. i cant emphasize enough how IRL Dostoyevsky never shut up about religion either, so i would've been surprised if it never came up, but it does, and it keeps going. dazai + fyodor debate about the nature of god and humans. steinbeck tells q that \"there is a god. he just doesn't love you\" when they capture them. the decay of angels is LOADED with religious allusions (even if you dont consider Yukio Mishima's tetralogy and just analyze it as an organization in bsd fitzgerald refers to Yokohama as \"the promised land\" and fyodor *alludes* to dazai that he's envisioning a paradise (world without gifted). also super important: it's not just Christianity or western religion either. there's a lot of Buddhism, Shintō, and Confucianism, though im not an expert on eastern religions at all. like with Christianity in the West, even if you're not religious its hard to not be at least a little bit knowledgeable on these religions + see their cultural/social impact, so even if asagiri or harukawa aren't themselves religious i have no doubt they know *of* various religious traditions, practices, and imagery that they then apply to bsd.\n\nyou're also right about oda being a jesus figure. you can make that argument soundly, although i dont think it was asagiri's main concern (Christianity isn't as significant in comparison to eastern religions in this context). but yes the biblical + ressurection associations are hard to ignore. i know oda won't literally come back to life (his death hinges too much on the story's basic foundations), but he is brought back in spirit as, yes, playing the role of dazai's guardian angel (or i guess \"moral compass\" or at the very least someone he looks up to), and through the ripple effects he is responsible for: atsushi, the armed detective agency's foundation, dazai's escape from the pm, etc. plus he's, like, totally got something to do with the decay of angels the untold origins novel really laid that out plain and center. it's like a sign blaring RELIGION RELIGION RELIGION FOCUS ON RELIGION. i can think up of examples in both the LNs and manga, but i dont remember specific page numbers, just moments that made me raise my eyebrow and go \"i know what you're doing.\" \n\n i guess i am kind of like ranpo in that i dont understand why others dont understand something that's so obvious to me, but i dont necessarily think its bc of a lack of reading comprehension or anything like that. like i dont mind explaining, but first i have to know what /needs/ to be explained, so that's why i thought everyone knew all this","media":null,"senderData":{"id":22076665,"verified":false,"username":"Pro_Pinkist","twitterid":1391125204437553200,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":0,"askboxtext":null,"avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1655945149/avatars/22076665.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1655945149/banners/22076665.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":false,"created_at":1655945149,"last_online":null},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1305482000,"likes":0,"timestamp":1674442582,"seconds_elapsed":53133535,"comment":"hi ! do you have any favorite paintings or pieces of art?

(he loves his friends, he loves watching them from a distance and knowing they're having a good time, he's just not that interactive and that's alright). honestly id say he's happiest when he's not alone, it's just that he's not used to it. he clearly likes /being/ alone, but nobody likes being lonely. he's human just like the rest of us\n\nalso idk how mbti works either so i unfortunately cannot help you there.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1304998506,"likes":0,"timestamp":1674175171,"seconds_elapsed":53400946,"comment":"Hi, EU! \nHave you read Anton Chekhov's play, \"The Cherry Orchard\" ?

(the winter aesthetics, brown hair + brown eyes, long coat, blue dress shirt, him being a fucking detective, him carrying around a book about suicide just everywhere, etc. -- it feels like asagiri took my own OC from me, but i don't care). anyway, it reached a point where i realized \"oh my god, he's too much like me. what the fuck.\" i can't emphasize enough how accurate he is to who i am as a person. all my friends agree and they think it's freaky too. i have been consuming stories from such a young age and none of the characters I've ever encountered can compare to how exactly he is to me. i genuinely, genuinely wish i was better (i wish i was like oda, but im not). the more i got into bsd and the deeper i got to know the characters + dazai, there were small details about him that eerily applied to me in ways i literally would have had to tell to asagiri + harukawa for it to be real and in one character, but i didn't. it was like dominoes. i am stuck with him. i don't even have a word for him. i know i sound crazy but in my head he's just me. it's like if someone wrote a book about you, your personality, and your thoughts without consulting you and then let you read it for yourself. i am stuck here.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1304862337,"likes":0,"timestamp":1673912238,"seconds_elapsed":53663879,"comment":"i think if you ever read my fanfiction i will be really happy 🤭 but only if you like it!! and of course i am not telling you which one is, i just want you to know how much i value your opinion (even though i never talked to you, i think i did it once tbh) i just think you are really cool 😅✨️","reply":"🥺🥺 thank u for valuing my opinion that much, but pls always remember its good to validate yourself! i unfortunately don't read many fanfics because I read so much for school and work, but if I ever randomly stumble across it i hope i'll like it too :) (also u can talk to me if u want whether on here or on dms)","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1304717378,"likes":0,"timestamp":1673890923,"seconds_elapsed":53685194,"comment":"Thoughts on this Dazai mental health analysis?\nhttps://youtu.be/uBr-SUx0zto","reply":"i will watch it soon and will most likely tweet my thoughts on my account so stay tuned hehe","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1304678438,"likes":0,"timestamp":1673890778,"seconds_elapsed":53685339,"comment":"Is 7 dollars worth it for palm sized happiness (a dazai mochi)","reply":"only $7????

The Overcoat's also one of the best renditions of any of the IRL authors' works in my opinion, since Eugène-Melchior de Vogüé said \"We all came from Gogol's Overcoat,\" in reference to russian (and east European) literature. like he's really foundational in eastern European lit studies so it was really really cool seeing him appear. i really love the spin on it in bsd, it fits IRL Gogol as well as his works (at least from what I've read of him; i need to read more gogol). i also think his interactions with sigma and fyodor are really funny. his whole bird metaphor with fyodor and having to kill him's really cool; i like that he's associated with birds and birdcages. i'm excited to see him animated and the merch that comes out of season 4 since they might put him + the decay of angels in \"normal\" clothes. also excited for him, sigma, mushitarou, and the hunting dogs to appear in mayoi. yeah overall i like him; his birthday's super close to mine so i feel like we have a strange connection bc of that","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1304553609,"likes":0,"timestamp":1673668367,"seconds_elapsed":53907750,"comment":"Idk man I could just live without problems and no struggles.

i think) that he must've gotten when he was a child and picked a fight with someone in preschool. but, since the themes of bsd render technicalities like \"are you *actually* human or just x, y, z?\" the specifics and details are essentially left meaningless and it quickly turns into a debate on what counts as human, non-human, or something in between. i'd personally say chuuya *is* human though, regardless of his origins: he couldn't choose where he came from or how he came to be, but he actively chooses everyday where to go from there. he chooses to live. so i'd say he's plenty human","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1304338242,"likes":0,"timestamp":1673508310,"seconds_elapsed":54067807,"comment":"Not all men!!!","reply":"i hate all men but .............. waymond <3","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null},"in_response_to":{"id":1303376394,"likes":0,"timestamp":1672712730,"seconds_elapsed":54863387,"comment":"in another life, i would’ve really liked just doing laundry… and taxes with you.","reply":"lives were changed. i was gutted. peak cinema.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1304316083,"likes":0,"timestamp":1673508289,"seconds_elapsed":54067828,"comment":"have you watched/read moriarty the patriot (yuuko no moriarty)?

I somehow always assumed its a boring, scientific story","reply":"WRONG frankenstein's a masterpiece even if you dont personally like it (I've literally only met one person who read it + disliked it and i have since stopped talking to them bc they're a fool), you can't deny it's a gorgeously rich text and that mary shelley was a GENIUS. i know im extremely biased bc frankenstein's one of my favorite books -- the second i started reading it i was entranced and been long haunted by it since -- but it's genuinely just so good. the themes of science vs religion, bodily autonomy, genealogy, parenthood, the question of god, the question of Adam, the limits of progress, the horrors of industrialization, etc. it's truly a treasured artefact of its time. i get that it can be difficult to read bc it was written in the in 19th century, but the plot and the writing itself is so elegantly done there are SO many great lines like \"“Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it\" and “I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other\" and \"“I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel...” IT ALL SLAPS OKAY IT ALL GOES SO HARD AND ITS FAME ALONE AS A STORY/CONCEPT IS ENOUGH TO TESTIFY TO ITS TIMELESSNESS. i usually dont say this for many books but if you end up thinking frankenstein's boring you did not read it in a way that benefitted you at all as both a person and a reader. out of my top 5 favorite books, it's the one i always recommend because i genuinely think it can be enjoyed by anyone. i also highly encourage looking deeper and looking at both scholarship /and/ personal reviews of Frankenstein; it's such a classic cult story. it literally /created/ the genre of science fiction. it's so, so brilliant. the context of how it was written is its own kind of miracle too. mary shelley wrote it when she was only 18/19. she basically came up with the idea in the span of one night. it was revolutionary and she knew it would be. like \"I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous\" ??? popped the FUCK off i am forever changed, always haunted, eternally grateful because of Frankenstein (or, the modern prometheus) by mary wollstonecraft-godwin shelley","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}}}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1302745370,"likes":0,"timestamp":1672179775,"seconds_elapsed":55396343,"comment":"For some reason I’m surprised you’re a dog person haha like….FIVE???","reply":"i turn into a completely different person when im around dogs i love them u have no idea. when i went to new york and we were supposed to see central park + madison square garden i *literally* got distracted by a nearby dog park and stayed there for 1 hour until it was dark. i love dogs theyre so dumb and stupid every dog is a good dog\n\ni get why people tend to think im a cat person but im very much not lmao im allergic to really fluffy cats. cats do really like me though, its kind of funny\n\nEDIT: id also like to add i have a close friend who is exactly like atsushi to me and i call them my cat, so i guess that counts right?","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1302736929,"likes":0,"timestamp":1672170642,"seconds_elapsed":55405476,"comment":"do u have any pets","reply":"i have five dogs they are all shih tzus, spoiled, and very stupid","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1302735015,"likes":0,"timestamp":1672169585,"seconds_elapsed":55406533,"comment":"Have you ever dreamed having sex with your sibling?","reply":"no all my dreams are about murder","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1302692103,"likes":0,"timestamp":1672169459,"seconds_elapsed":55406659,"comment":"women sleep so soundly… who knows?

I should share it w Eu hehe anyway you know how in Sunday tragedy p2 (I think) as Nikolai is talking about being free and how he’s jealous of people who aren’t aware of the cage they’re in ect ect.. it shows someone writing down Nikolai’s words. I’ve seen people and ( this is probably what’s true) is that it’s Fukuchi writing down on the page to frame the detective agency. But to me i believe those are Nikolai’s feelings and for him to be forced to say that is just like takes away his eccentric and raw heartfelt feelings in that moment imo, (I say this cause a lot of people I’ve seen equate those words to being fukuchis feelings and Nikolai is just the vessel to say them” but what if it’s not even fukuchi writing on the page at all and it’s like how at the end of 15 we see Ango writing a report and detailing the whole thing yk?? And so if Ango is able to read the memories then ofc he’d write ‘he says’ cus I feel like writing such an intricate dialogue on such a small page is very wasteful and it’s been explained many times how they have such a limited space they can’t just write details that they can take care of themselves yk??

I somehow always assumed its a boring, scientific story","reply":"WRONG frankenstein's a masterpiece even if you dont personally like it (I've literally only met one person who read it + disliked it and i have since stopped talking to them bc they're a fool), you can't deny it's a gorgeously rich text and that mary shelley was a GENIUS. i know im extremely biased bc frankenstein's one of my favorite books -- the second i started reading it i was entranced and been long haunted by it since -- but it's genuinely just so good. the themes of science vs religion, bodily autonomy, genealogy, parenthood, the question of god, the question of Adam, the limits of progress, the horrors of industrialization, etc. it's truly a treasured artefact of its time. i get that it can be difficult to read bc it was written in the in 19th century, but the plot and the writing itself is so elegantly done there are SO many great lines like \"“Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it\" and “I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other\" and \"“I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel...” IT ALL SLAPS OKAY IT ALL GOES SO HARD AND ITS FAME ALONE AS A STORY/CONCEPT IS ENOUGH TO TESTIFY TO ITS TIMELESSNESS. i usually dont say this for many books but if you end up thinking frankenstein's boring you did not read it in a way that benefitted you at all as both a person and a reader. out of my top 5 favorite books, it's the one i always recommend because i genuinely think it can be enjoyed by anyone. i also highly encourage looking deeper and looking at both scholarship /and/ personal reviews of Frankenstein; it's such a classic cult story. it literally /created/ the genre of science fiction. it's so, so brilliant. the context of how it was written is its own kind of miracle too. mary shelley wrote it when she was only 18/19. she basically came up with the idea in the span of one night. it was revolutionary and she knew it would be. like \"I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous\" ??? popped the FUCK off i am forever changed, always haunted, eternally grateful because of Frankenstein (or, the modern prometheus) by mary wollstonecraft-godwin shelley","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1301534364,"likes":0,"timestamp":1671274216,"seconds_elapsed":56301902,"comment":"i wanna read the uncensored version SO BAD but i can never find it its absolutely insane. and youre right it has so many good lines i loved the ones you mentioned 😭","reply":"you can try downloading it from here: https://booksvooks.com/the-uncensored-picture-of-dorian-gray-pdf-oscar-wilde.html. it can also be bought off of harvard university press: https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674066311 and amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Uncensored-Picture-Dorian-Gray/dp/0674066316\n\nthis article posts some highlighted snippets of the uncensored manuscript if u just wanna skim it a little: https://hup.medium.com/the-uncensored-picture-of-dorian-gray-9230a220eed8\n\nhope that helps :) the uncensored version's so great i can understand *really* wanting to read it","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null},"in_response_to":{"id":1301511906,"likes":0,"timestamp":1671154344,"seconds_elapsed":56421774,"comment":"what do you think about the picture of dorian gray? i really love seeing you talk about books and was curious on your thoughts about dorian since its on of my favs 😄","reply":"read it just after i graduated hs it's so gay there is absolutely zero (and i mean ZERO) chance that there is a heterosexual explanation for literally anything that happens in that dramatic as hell book. oscar wilde was WILD, pun intended. also if u haven't already highly recommend reading the unabridged/uncensored version because its EVEN MORE GAY, JUST WAIT. there're so many banger lines too (in either version) like Wilde put his whole Oscarussy into this text “You will always be fond of me.

This is a broad and vague question and I know you don't have time to go very in-depth on BSD right now, but I wanted to ask, what are your general thoughts on where the series has been going lately?

Favorite recent character dynamics/plot threads that have been brought up? Okay sorry I know that was actually a lot of questions a;skdgkflds, I'm just really curious to know your feelings! I know a lot of people have been bored lately, and admittedly I have been a little bit too (it's easy for me to not be as much as others though because I only just recently caught up on 5 years' worth of chapters in about two weeks lmao oops-), because the plot has been juggling a lot of things lately, perhaps a little to its detriment imo. But I still have faith in where Asagiri is going to take things in the end, however that may be and however long it may take for said things to happen, and I especially still believe that Dazai's arc is going to go exactly how you've always preached it will. 💖 I'm gonna be on this wild ride for as long as it lasts lmao, as I'm sure you are too.

just wanted to say that i'm not even an odazai shipper but i would defend you with everything. really sick of seeing people sending you those stupid messages and forgetting there's an actual real person behind the account\n\ni also think the odazai age difference argument is a bit senseless. 4 years is generally a normal difference in many couples, for one. i have parents who are only a month apart in age and i can still see that. secondly, it's just not realistic to assume that someone like dazai could not have a crush on someone like oda. i can relate to dazai a lot and if i had an oda in my life, i'd have a huge crush on him too. i am more or less anti proshipping but even i can see that odazai are a normal ship. and twitter morality should not be connected to irl morality. i don't think most people who are sending you hate CCs are approaching this realistically (if we push aside normal human empathy for a minute)\n\nbut this was just my rambling. i really hope you're ok. i've seen your CCs and i got a little worried but you're handling them so well. you're really strong. i can relate to your mental health struggles so it was painful to see people treating you awfully despite knowing about them. but many of us are here for you ❤️\n\nand random question but since you're a literature student- what's your favourite book that you've read for uni?","reply":"thank you! that really means a lot. thank you for seeing me as a person, i've been feeling quite dehumanized by a lot of the rude comments lately. i also appreciate your comments on odazai, but i just wanna repeat that i find it totally okay if people are uncomfortable with it; im not going to defend why i like something the same way i dont expect people to defend why they dislike something. i dont even consider odazai proshipping compared to some other examples; it really is just a comfort ship to me and i am just minding my own business. i dont think people are approaching this realistically either; a lot of the arguments are just downright silly I've burst out laughing a couple times.\n\nthank you again. im trying to be okay and support like this is what keeps me going. thank you for being here for me. that isn't just me being polite, i genuinely feel the kindness and im always always grateful for it.\n\nALSO !!! what a great question it's so hard to pick a favorite book i had to read for class i think ill have to go with Anne of Green Gables by L.M. Montgomery or Far From the Madding Crowd by Thomas Hardy. Id been wanting to read those two books for so long and i was so happy my classes gave me an excuse to read them bc i knew id love them and i did <3","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1299414481,"likes":1,"timestamp":1669415988,"seconds_elapsed":58160130,"comment":"Geez, I don't know how do you deal with these weird (and creepy) and death threats.

can you please tell your thoughts about what dazai's nightmares could consist of? i have been thinking about this alot recently i would love to hear your take on it 🧐","reply":"i very much believe all 5 senses are active in dazai's dreams so it adds to how everything feels *real* to him. obviously sometimes he can discern between \"this is real\" and \"this is a dream\" but, as everyone knows, it's really difficult to do that when you're so vulnerable and asleep. so yes, i think his sight, touch, smell, taste, and hearing are active, and since his brain notices + collects information more than average it can turn against him. for example, his head knows what all the ada members' voices sound like, so in his nightmares they could get warped into saying harmful things like \"we don't want you here\" or \"you should just die,\" even though none of the members would actually say that; ofc dazai never brings this up but he /knows/ what atsushi would sound like telling him he's unwanted, and it must really weigh heavily on him. on top of everything feeling real as well, it must be so jarring waking up -- in the middle of the night or the morning. like i imagine he dreams about odasaku's death a lot (vividly), but then all of a sudden his alarm rings or he wakes up naturally and he's covered in sweat and shaking before he finally realizes he's *not* with odasaku, he's in his room, and even if he 100% thought he was reliving that moment, now he has to get up and get ready for work. he dreams about the mafia, mori, his missions, all the deaths, all the screaming, the tortures, the loneliness, the dark, the abandonment. so much so that i think dazai's nightmares a lot of the time feel like a \"double life\" to him and he constantly pretends like it's not, but it feels like it is. i think he stays up late and consciously avoids sleeping bc he's genuinely scared of the stuff he experiences; but at the same time he's just so, so tired. when we go to sleep we're supposed to recharge and get rest, but with dazai's case he hardly ever gets the chance to do that, so he's just constantly exhausted. it must torture him to no end that there's no cure for nightmares.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

I've just spent the last 4 days being told my random strangers to kill myself and I've been keeping quiet for most of it, but when i really think back on it all, it's really just so ... so ... stupid.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1298828002,"likes":0,"timestamp":1668897768,"seconds_elapsed":58678351,"comment":"what do you do for work","reply":"im a writing tutor, i help students at my university edit their essays and other writing projects. i also start my TAship this upcoming January, as long as a few other editorial responsibilities for different things in the English department. so yeah very literary-heavy","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1298859409,"likes":0,"timestamp":1668897649,"seconds_elapsed":58678470,"comment":"I didn't mean to talk down to you or anything btw!!

(i literally havent looked at my following list in ages). i don’t owe bsdtwt anything, especially as of late, and its disturbing how entitled people are to *my life* and *myself* that they go to *my* account and make demands as if the internet is rightfully theirs. im here bc i love bsd and i wanted to talk about literature with like minded people, and it has been really wonderful, i do really appreciate it here, but all ive been getting recently is crap. so, no, of course i dont like the death threats. ive been suicidal for as long i can remember and everyone who knows me — really knows me — is extremely distressed about all the shit i’ve been getting. if not for me i want more than anything for them to not worry about this nonsense. im not going to address this issue again bc im tired. no offence intended to you anon ofc people have just been bothering me relentlessly over this and im done with it. im done with it.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

you can even advertise the fact that it's inspired by well-known authors as a positive, since i believe bsd is a great gateway for modern readers to access old literature that's otherwise difficult to understand or connect with. that's one of the series' best features imo -- i find people /do/ want to know more about books but it's just so intimidating, but bsd throws that out the window by making these authors contemporary again through a very popular medium: anime and manga. i'd definitely try to \"sell\" the anime and/or manga, since it's more digestible for people than a light novel or even a book from one of the IRL authors, so people would be more inclined to check it out if it requires little effort on their part. i pitch bsd to pretty much everyone i meet tbh so this project's highkey perfect. i wish you luck on it!

i was wondering, since odasaku is a pretty controversial ship considering from the light novels oda knew dazai since he was 15, what made you still think odazai is not controversial? because actually i myself dont think theyre either, since i dont think dazai’s love towards odasaku considered platonic after the relationship they grow throughout the year which made dazais realization of love, and odasaku is definitely not grooming dazai in any way. so i really want to know your thoughts bout odazai, Thanks!  sorry if my english is bad!","reply":"your english isnt bad, dw i can understand you! i think it's undeniable that odazai is controversial since it stirs such emotional responses from the entire fandom, but it's all really unnecessary bc it all boils down to random strangers on the internet policing what content, ships, and fandom experiences other people 'should' have. ive had people tell me why odazai makes them uncomfortable, and im not gonna sit there and say \"well you're being too sensitive\" bc that's valid; feel free to block me, no hard feelings at all. but when people come to my cc anonymously telling me why i as a person am immoral, a pedophile, and other harmful things that aren't true just bc i like odazai, that's objectively ridiculous. im not going to \"defend\" or \"justify\" why i like something; i just do. its literally hurting no one *but* me, since people keep telling me i should die for shipping two fictional characters together. i myself am not a stranger to pedophilia and grooming. i know what that is, more than most. odazai isn't that. to me, odazai's comfort, odazai's home, odazai's about finally finding safety in a world where it's so rare. it's love, and i love it. i hope this answers your question. im not trying to be rude to you anon ofc thank u for messaging me so kindly about this topic, but even as im typing this all now im getting ridiculous comments from strangers on the internet who've automatically made assumptions about me and therefore decided it's okay to just bother me in my own account, in my own space","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

Asagiri makes it very clear that BEAST Mori and canon Mori are very different people, since it's an alternate universe. We know virtually nothing about Mori (and his relationship with Dazai) in the BEASTverse, only that when Dazai rose to become the boss he spared Mori's life. I agree there's some potential to interpret their relationship as Mori caring about Dazai when he picked him up as a kid in BEAST, but there's just too little evidence to suggest canon Mori is working from the same angle. Like I said, I agree that Mori does have a weird soft spot for Dazai and not everything he does is exactly the decisions a calculating, manipulate abuser who aims for the best solution would always do, but it is the overwhelming majority. Mori admits that Dazai was a flaw in his calculations, and that's why he's simultaneously fascinated with him even at 22 and also terrified of him. Mori keeping him alive from the suicide and assassination attempts is strange, but I don't think it necessarily means he cares for Dazai outside of using him as a tool, or a protege.\n\nI don't know what you mean about Mori being shown to regret his circumstances in canon, nor about him showing remorse for how he treated Dazai. Even at Fifteen Dazai's wariness towards Mori's there, and by the time we see their dynamic in Dark Era it's obviously snowballed to a total tension between them now that Dazai's older and less easier to control. I think you're right in that Dazai coming to Mori shows he must've trusted or depended on him to some extent -- Mori was the only adult figure in Dazai's life as far as we know in 14; Mori *did* take him under his wing, so Dazai would naturally attach himself psychologically-speaking, but I believe it's more complicated than that. The confrontation scene in Dark Era's so chilling because it's Dazai at a loss for words, not knowing what to do, and then slowly realizing the enemy he's fighting against is his own boss, the main who raised him those past 3 years. He was speechless because some part of him thought Mori wouldn't betray him like this, since Mori *knew* Dazai loved Oda, and he still didn't care \"for the good of the organization.\" There's definitely a lot to make of their relationship in canon, as well as in BEAST, but in the latter it's even foggier than the former.

I think the Port Mafia and Mori’s care was one of the safest spots for Dazai when Mori first found him. That's the tragedy of BSD; the whole point is these teenagers, their lives are so inherently dangerous that joining the mafia is literally an upgrade. Mori was literally looking out for the mafia teenagers more than anyone else around them was. When a fucking mob boss cares about these kids more than anyone else - more than the government, more than any living family they may or may not even have, more than any other adults who Akutagawa and Gin encountered before Dazai recruited them, there's some major systemic issues in play.\n\nThat is the story of Bungou Stray Dogs. These characters who by real world standards would widely be considered horrible are somehow protecting these teenagers better than the rest of their society. They're equipping them to better protect themselves and stay alive in a world that's inherently dangerous for them to exist in because no one who's considered \"good\" will step up and take care of teenagers with abilities. And I think part of why I’m so attached to the series is because of how true this is to life — the people who are most willing to help the most vulnerable people are also vulnerable themselves. They have *seen* some shit and that's why they care so much,\nand many of said people in the real world aren't considered \"good\" by society because of how stigmatized their experiences are. They're usually on the fringes themselves which simultaneously makes them the only people who know how to help others like them, and also the people with the least capacity to do so.\n\nMori can't help himself, so he's trying to help Dazai. He doesn't want Dazai to end up regretting all of his life decisions the way he did. So he does scummy, shitty things to protect other people, and he manipulates to lead Dazai away from choices mirroring the ones he regrets. I think that sort of protective effort is almost more admirable coming from someone who's resigned himself to doing horrible things in the name of protecting other people - he doesn't think he can change his fate, so he's trying to prevent Dazai from going down the same path.\n\nThe way I see it, Bungou Stray Dogs is about society’s systemic failure to protect children, and the desperate attempts of the people who survived this violent world to give the next generation a chance to be better than them. Wow that last sentence is a mouthful but I hope it makes sense lol","reply":"I agree that BSD draws light on how a system that inevitably necessitates the subordination of children into dangerous lifestyles and organizations is inherently broken. Asagiri's definitely doing a nuanced social commentary there, with the examples of Akutagawa + Gin, Dazai + Chuuya at 15, Yumeno, and even Ranpo, Kenji, and Kyouka. Aya's also a good example. \n\nI don't agree that Mori didn't abuse Dazai. Maybe yes being under Mori's wing was the \"safest\" Dazai was able to get in his situation at 14. The PM under Mori's tutelage undoubtedly gave him better protection than if he hadn't joined, as well as basic resources like food, shelter, medical assistance, and even education, so I agree that it must've been an \"upgrade\" somewhat, but I can't shake off the feeling that Mori is an abuser. I think he definitely has a weird soft spot for Dazai, but whether he's \"looking out for him\" or wants what's best for him, I don't think it adds up. Or at least not in a black/white way. (Keep in mind we don't know much about Mori and Dazai's dynamic too). I believe Asagiri's moreso pointing towards the sharp irony of Mafiosi and mob bosses taking in children, not because those people are as \"vulnerable,\" but because they see children as tools, whereas the government and 'normal' society consider them detritus. So I think you're right that BSD does criticize the broken systemic issues of the world as we know it, and who we view as \"good\" or \"bad,\" and it is true to life for better or for worse, but with the example of Mori I don't see him as vulnerable at all. With the example of Fukuzawa or maybe even Odasaku, I can see the argument that the people with stigmatized experiences are \"usually on the fringes themselves which simultaneously makes them the only people who know how to help others like them, and also the people with the least capacity to do so.,\" but with Mori, no. I see Mori as being more sinisterly complex than a marginalized, misunderstood adult who saw himself reflected in Dazai and other children (i.e. Yumeno and Chuuya) and thus decided to take them in out of a morally gray sense of caretaking. I think Mori's actually an example of someone growing up in these horrible circumstances and embracing it and actively choosing to perpetuate it for gain. All the evidence and interactions between Dazai and him portray a strained, even bitter (at least on Dazai's side) relationship, and I just can't see how the underlying tension behind it all is that not of an abused child and an adult abuser.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null},"in_response_to":{"id":1296446012,"likes":0,"timestamp":1667009961,"seconds_elapsed":60566158,"comment":"I have some thoughts on BSD that I'm curious about your opinions on? i lowkey wrote an essay on it (over 400 words) and I don't want to like. send it completely unsolicited. but i think youd have some cool insights or additional thoughts on it","reply":"id love to read it ! you can talk to me in my dms or if u dont feel comfy w that u can send me a link of the essay on here and ill share my thoughts 🥰","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1296639931,"likes":0,"timestamp":1667115107,"seconds_elapsed":60461012,"comment":"watching my tl slander you while giggling at your dark humour, they're lucky they didn't get hit with apathy towards the world like everything is normal at this point the world is fucked up and I've just accepted it does that make sense","reply":"i actually think most of the people 'slandering' me *are* apathetic towards the world and that's why they feel a need to be these purist 'woke' anime twitter police who oddly think they're being 'correct' and maybe even 'righteous' by telling someone who they (misunderstood) as neurotypical and therefore antagonistically inhuman to kill themselves/deactivate twitter/die. it's just a phenomenon of social media. it happens. but since i am *not* apathetic towards the world while also knowing it is fucked up and accepted it (yes i understand what you mean), im choosing to believe that, had the misunderstanding been cleared, and people took the time to get context + explanation, a lot of them would probably relate to my use of dark humor to cope with mental illness/ND. even if they didn't see me as a person, that doesn't stop me from remembering they are, and most of them are obviously hurting.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1296639947,"likes":0,"timestamp":1667114662,"seconds_elapsed":60461457,"comment":"I wanna hear your analysis on chuuya!

The one you wrote about why Dazai will be okay in the end is my absolute favorite, and I would LOVE to read the one you mentioned about his redemption (srsly I would pay so much 😭), because it really feels like you're the only one who /gets/ it and is invested in the series for the same reasons I am - reading all your analyses are like seeing my thoughts put into words much better than I could (and with an actual literature degree to back it up lol; I feel like I myself have a pretty good grasp of these things, but I do not have the degree lol), and it's so rewarding to read, honestly. Obviously though I completely understand how busy you are (I wish you luck with your MA!) and I don't blame you for being so demoralized; I just wish there was another place you could continue to post these, because they're amazing and honestly twitter doesn't deserve them, or you.

Idk how to end this, I hope this doesn't come across as a guilt-trip 😭 I'm just really sorry things have gotten to this point; you're a cool person and you have such amazing thoughts and you've never deserved any of this.

I've had suicidality for most of my (remembered) life and i know it's not that simple; killing yourself isn't always selfish. i also agree dazai was most likely neurodivergent, as my ND friends and i also see a lot of ourselves + our experiences in his portrayal of oba's trust issues and struggles with society in NLH. that's what i meant when i said dazai didn't have the proper healthcare access he might've had if he'd lived in the 21st century now (although neurodivergent diagnoses is notoriously gatekept against asian men and women especially). it's problematic to say \"he wouldn't have died if he lived now bc of modern medicine,\" but i do believe he would've had more of a chance, and he might've not felt so alone.\n\nthat being said, yes, he isn't the problem in terms of him being the victim in an able-bodied, neurotypical society, but he is most definitely \"the problem\" when you're talking about he + his wife's relationship as he did cheat on her, multiple times, and he himself understood it to be immoral. i understand how one's mental state can affect one's decisions, but that isn't an excuse for going against something as important (and legally binding, may i add) as wedding vows and promises to a significant other. depression doesn't make you cheat; you being a cheater makes you cheat.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null},"in_response_to":{"id":1295108973,"likes":0,"timestamp":1665880913,"seconds_elapsed":61695206,"comment":"lmaoosjsjsjjd,,, and ik im gonna come across all “you’re depressed??

And what do you think would it take for him to overcome his fear? \nI love hearing your interpretations btw!!","reply":"ahahahah . . . hah . . . how to answer this one . . . im really biased but being vulnerable with other people's terrifying as hell. i think miranda july best puts it, “Finally, in a low whisper, he said, ‘I think I might be a terrible person.’ For a split second I believed him -- I thought he was about to confess a crime, maybe a murder. Then I realized that we all think we might be terrible people. But we only reveal this before asking someone to love us. It is a kind of undressing.\" There's also the Maya Hornbacher quote, \"I did not like to be touched, but it was a strange dislike. I did not like to be touched because I craved it too much. I wanted to be held very tight so I would not break.\"\n\nfrom my experience, i think a lot of people tend to take vulnerability in relationships for granted. like most people i know tell their best friend *everything* and they have someone they can turn to and a shoulder to cry on always, and vice versa. dazai, on the other hand, doesn't have that. the obvious reason is that he *did* have something like that, most likely when he was very young, but he lost it; hence him saying \"Everything worth wanting is lost the moment I obtain it. And nothing I pursue is worth the cost of prolonging this life, this suffering.\" So it's safe to assume he's speaking from (internalized) experience here. We can fill in the blanks and substitute \"everything worth wanting\" = \"love, human connection, understanding, acceptance, etc.\" dazai's a fundamentally sentimental person, you can see it in everything he does, even when he tries not to be, but i get the sense that, in being so lonely, he of all people knows how precious a genuine human connection is (i.e. why odasaku affected him so much), yet he's also simultaneously always wary of the pain that inevitably comes with loving someone and being loved back. i think his mind works faster than he wants it to and so any time something new starts, like a friendship, he's already thinking about when it'll end. he's just so used to being hurt, betrayed, misunderstood, or abandoned that he thinks it *has* to happen eventually -- maybe not even to other people, but him specifically, since i also get the sense he not only distances himself from others, but from people as a whole. his heart's just always bleeding. that's what it's like to be no longer human.\n\nas for him overcoming this fear, i think he is gradually doing that. i think with the ADA he's opened up a little bit more. he's smiling more. he loves his job. he thinks of them as his friends and dedicates so much time, energy, and planning to keeping the city safe for them. i don't think he'll ever let the walls completely down, but you don't need him to tear them all down to get a glimpse of his soul. with time, there'll be cracks in the bricks, and you can look inside.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1296120795,"likes":0,"timestamp":1666688549,"seconds_elapsed":60887570,"comment":"wjshsjabjas im invited to a halloween party that’s edgar allan poe themed and i’m dressing up as one of the guests from the masque of the red death.

(straight cisgendered allosexual people never do this). how i define asexuality is little to no sexual attraction. that's it. asexuality doesn't mean celibacy, virginity, no sex, or anything of the sort. it just means you don't experience sexual attraction at the \"normal\" level. you can still have a high sex drive, you can still masturbate, you can still like sex, etc.\n\nthis is 100% my own analogy, and there are many faults to it, but it's like feeling like you want to take a run. some people *really love running* and are very into the idea of running as in they're usually down for it if it's suggested, they get really into it, and they look forward to it when they're not doing it. i don't really like running. when i'm running, sure, it's whatever. sometimes i think about running in the background. i have running shoes, but i mostly just use them for everyday stuff, like getting groceries or going on a walk. i hardly ever feel up to running, and honestly i never really look forward to it. i could have fun while doing it, but generally, i just don't care about running. it's not an attractive concept to me. i'm never going to identify as a \"runner,\" even if i run everyday, even if i join a marathon, even if i go to the olympics, since it's just not something i'm that interested in.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1295692953,"likes":0,"timestamp":1666334674,"seconds_elapsed":61241445,"comment":"I’m not the same anon, but i’m starting uni soon and am going into eng lit and am worried about not knowing how to analyze properly. idk why but i feel like i just don’t understand books how they’re supposed to be understood. have you seen people go from average to good analyzers? how’d they do it? i know you learn as you go, but i feel like ill just be so much behind everyone else.","reply":"congrats on starting uni! very exciting, but ofc also very anxiety-inducing. i get what you mean. i've been in English for years and i still don't feel like i'm understanding books how they're supposed to be understood, but then i remember there is no \"proper\" way to analyze, interpret, or a specific way you're \"supposed\" to understand something. so i guess yes i have seen people go from not knowing anything at all, to average, to good, to really good, and then constantly improving from there. you're not behind everyone else (it's not a race or a contest); you do learn as you go but sometimes big epiphanies happen and suddenly things sort of just click. there's really no way to plan it. my advice is to always ask questions to your profs. listen to your peers who you think are good analyzers and learn from them. do the work you can. be open-minded. remember that there's no \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer, just interpretations, and how well you can back them up using the text as evidence. i know that sounds super hard but it will and it does get easier. humans are programmed to catch patterns, symbols, images, and affectations, and we've been storytelling for millennia, so it's a part of you. always. you're gonna be stellar.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null},"in_response_to":{"id":1295598928,"likes":0,"timestamp":1666326015,"seconds_elapsed":61250104,"comment":"Hii !

your friend *needs* a friend, and for that to happen you also need to take care of yourself), but really even small things help, like picking up their favorite pastry while passing by a bakery, or getting them some juice on your way to the cafeteria, etc.\n\nalso, the myth that some foods are dangerous and harmful is pretty much bs. like yeah obviously don't just eat pork steak 3 times a day forever and ever, but you're *not* gonna die if you eat one bag of chips in one sitting bc there's literally nothing else you can stomach rn. encourage your friend to eat whatever they want. be supportive and *do not make any comments on any body or appearance changes like them gaining weight (weight is good for anorexia!) or getting acne, etc.* be patient and kind, and never, ever blame yourself for how tough it is. your friend's lucky to have you","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

how do you read your books/texts and get the tones, nuances, language etc rather than just surface reading?","reply":"surface reading can help you get all of those! what you're essentially describing are vibes. so when you read something for the first time, you're probably confused, so you go, \"huh. why?\" then you go back and read again and try to understand at least what it's saying -- is what it's saying good vibes? or bad vibes? maybe mixed? then go deeper into why. is it bc the writer uses the word \"squelch\" a lot and that's why you find it disgusting? or do you think the vibes are off bc they mention death imagery (i.e. skulls, graveyards, ghosts, etc.) when they're talking about a loved one (looking at you edgar allan poe).\n\ni'm not exaggerating when i say you should trust your gut! art is meant to evoke emotions and reactions from you, so, a lot of the time, your initial feel of a work is a good angle to look at it. even if people don't like it and you do, don't worry about not being like everyone else and look deeper into *why* you think differently.\n\nsome other basic tips are: read the text out loud and see how your voice naturally dictates it (did your tone get suspicious, dramatic, romantic, etc.?); writing out the text yourself and seeing how your brain connects the sentence together (it's different *writing* a sentence than reading a sentence); check back on all the themes of the book you've maybe picked out so far -- or the genre! is it supposed to be darkly humorous? or is it more romantic comedy vibes? does the text deal a lot with themes of freedom or imprisonment? crime or punishment? take what you've already noticed and apply it to the passage(s) that're giving you trouble. it's really a trial and error process that you get better at over time, so don't be discouraged if you run into some struggles. it's supposed to test you!

:D I hope you’re doing well","reply":"it just shows how atsushi's both physically and emotionally began to extricate himself from his abusive past with the original orphanage director. dazai isn't his \"father figure\" and akutagawa even says dazai's not atsushi's mentor, but he definitely is someone atsushi looks up to and depends on; since atsushi's been alone all his life, dazai's arguably the first real significant relationship + bond he's had with another human being, so ofc atsushi treasures him in his heart. i don't think dazai's necessarily \"replaced\" the old orphanage director, since it's hard to erase trauma that deep in someone's soul, but i do think he's changing the way atsushi perceives himself and the world, as opposed to how the director conveyed it to him as cruel and monstrous when he was just a child. i also think dazai's hard rejection of the director (\"you don't have to forgive him\") is a sign of his own self-realization and maturity for the wrongs he's done to others, like akutagawa. dazai may not be exactly *ready* to face the consequences of his abuse (he may never be ever able to outright say \"sorry\" to the people he's hurt) but it's clear he's given it some thought, and he doesn't try to justify heinous actions. dazai-atsuhi-orphanage director bring up a lot of the most fascinating themes on the cycle of abuse and the relationships between abused + abuser. there's definitely more to it than I've said here + what I've written about but for now I'll leave it at that. hope you're also doing well anon!","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1295032186,"likes":0,"timestamp":1665871119,"seconds_elapsed":61705001,"comment":"omg i could go on and on abt dazai and mori's relationship. honestly, the part in dark era where it's mentioned that dazai feels like he's walking on a tightrope every time he talks to mori reminds me of yozo's perception of his father in no longer human (my connection could be piss poor tho, i've only read junji ito's adaption). i love exploring unhealthy father-son dynamics and the ideas of emotional abuse from a father with mori n dazai bc i <3 projecting lmfaooo","reply":"the part about mori + dazai's dynamic that fucks w me the most is in fifteen when asagiri casually mentioned dazai's not mori's accidental child, they're not father-son *exactly*, but something else. it's similar to that but it's really twisted as well. it's fascinating seeing how their relationship changes from when dazai was fourteen to when he was eighteen in dark era, i agree. the tension between them was much more prominent when dazai turned 18 -- hence the tightrope image -- and i believe it has something to do with the shift in power between them: dazai's not a \"kid\" anymore that mori can easily manipulate and use, and dazai, who's growing up, is beginning to realize the man who's been in charge of him for the majority of his teen years isn't the man he thought he was. i agree with you though i love their dynamic and exploring it, it's why i started writing Peach Flower Boy; but instead of father-son i made mori dazai's uncle -- more of a claudius and hamlet kind of situation","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null},"in_response_to":{"id":1295031333,"likes":0,"timestamp":1665811849,"seconds_elapsed":61764271,"comment":"what are ur thoughts on mori as a character?

For example, if you first read \"Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die, / Take him and cut him out in little stars, / And he will make the face of heaven so fine / That all the world will be in love with night / And pay no worship to the garish sun,\" you're probably wondering wtf Juliet's saying, so you should look up the Sparknotes (or its equivalent) translation and find that it's her saying, \"Come on, sun, hurry up and set. I wish some god would whip you forward so the cloudy night would come immediately. Let night wanderers blink and miss us and let Romeo leap into my arms unseen. Lovers can see well enough to make love by the light of beauty, and if they can’t, it won’t matter in the dark of night anyway. If only night would come like a proper widow dressed in black and teach me how to gain something by losing my virginity. Cover the virginal blush in my cheeks with your dark cloak until the strangeness of sex goes away and this act of true love seems natural and modest. Come on, night. Come on, Romeo, the bright part of my night. Through the dark you’ll seem like white snow on a raven’s back. Come dark and loving night, give me my Romeo. When I die, take him and cut out little stars from him and he will make the night sky so beautiful that the whole world will fall in love with night and forget the garish sun.\" Now, that's definitely a waaaay longer way of saying the same thing, but having the 'modernized' version is really good bc now you can compare + contrast that with the Elizabethan English. you can actually pick out which parts of the soliloquy relate to the translation, and practice trying to pick out *how* Shakespeare managed to poetically convey the translation in his own words. You keep doing this (it also helps having Shakespeare annotations on hand which explain the meaning of certain words like 'cankerblossom' or 'dropsy') and you eventually get used to the Elizabethan English to the point where you *can* read most of shakespeare's stuff fairly easily (with a bit of help). you're never going to understand the early modern English or the original text, but trust me, 99.99% of people are in the same boat. shakespeare can and *should* be accessible to a modern audience; you're not being 'less' of a reader for depending on other sources to help you understand, bc even the best of us in the field still do that! even after studying Shakespeare for like 40+ years!","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1294806729,"likes":0,"timestamp":1665642678,"seconds_elapsed":61933442,"comment":"Hi!!

also, ive read it but the extreme misogyny in it was really offputting, how did you learn to separate your own personal feelings and opinions from books written by people (mostly men) with such extremely differing views? tysm eu for your thoughtful replies always","reply":"i think he's both. i dont think anyone in bsd is ever 100% similar to either their IRL author counterpart or the work they were inspired by, that's why its fun trying to analyze the bsd characters as individual beings that tend to represent an author and, by extent, their entire canon of work. i don't think you can take yozo or dazai away from bsd dazai. it'd be like taking red or blue away from purple and then asking which color is more similar to the secondary color, yknow?\n\nalso, regarding the problematics, in my field you learn to get over it real quick. 'getting over it' requires time and patience though, and most of the time i don't read what i know I'll dislike (i.e. joseph conrad is a fat no from me). it isn't a matter of separating my personal views + opinions (like putting my humanitarian feminism on the shelf every time i open an ernest hemingway novel), but i retain them and choose to see the 'problematics' of the book the same way you view outdated stuff in an antique store, or a museum. for the majority of literature, a lot of the dumb shit said is a product of the times, the authors' privilege, and what the (usually cishet, white, able-bodied, upper middle class, literate, etc.) audience demanded of writers back then. it's not good to judge people from the past with the present's standards, but ofc i know a lot of the time this is rly hard, so it's really hit or miss. basically, remind yourself that the story you're holding is an artifact representative of its own time, people, society, and culture, and that those contexts can be acknowledged without approval or promotion of them. it also helps that most of the authors i read with shit opinions are dead. like, haha, wow you don't think immigrants belong in England haha well neither do *you* bitch you're fucking dead! go to hell for all i care none of my money's going to you its going to the nice bookshop owner down my street!","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1294814065,"likes":0,"timestamp":1665641022,"seconds_elapsed":61935098,"comment":"omg dude i thought it was a me problem everybody talking abt how SAD and HEARTBREAKING nlh is like it was just a fun read to me?

it's honestly one of my favorite fics and im glad that my dedication to it shines through. i wanted to show that i as the author am pro-choice ofc, but also express empathy and consideration towards people who have to make that (often difficult) decision in the first place. a lot of the discourse around women's bodies and rights, as expected, tend to focus more on the physical body and access to abortion, but i wanted to go into the more emotional side of it, as well as go against this idea a lot of people think that abortion = empowerment. in many ways it is, but i've heard so many experiences that remember it as just severely traumatizing -- nothing 'feminist' at all -- because abortion is one of the worst things a person may go through (even if it was the 'right choice'), and i feel that needs to be acknowledged. pro-choice does not mean pro-abortion in the sense that i want to diminish people's experiences + complicated emotions when it comes to abortion as a highly politicized thing. it is, but it's not, and people deserve to be treated with respect.\n\nregarding ayatsuji, i also wanted to use his character to touch on how partners experiencing abortion alongside (but not literally) their significant others may feel and react, as when people tend to think of abortion they only envision the one going through it (which is valid, but i think there's also value in seeing how it affects a genuine relationship bc, like ayatsuji says, it takes two, yknow?). anyway, yes, im very happy to see you appreciated my fic and thank you eternally for the incredibly kind comment. <3 tsuji^2 are my beloveds and i feel really lucky i was able to explore this topic with them as well.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

everything is about class. \n\nand honestly if all else fails just read the communist manifesto lmao","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

I was wondering what's your stance on dazai's morality as of the current canon timeline of bsd. Aside from honoring his wish to odasaku, it's hard to pinpoint if his heart belongs on the ''righteous'' side or not. he seems to be a trickster character who's neither rly pure or evil. i think theres a sharp contrast between him and the rest of the ADA for that reason since the rest of the ADA is motivated by a strong sense of justice and loyalty and devotion. As it stands, could you imagine dazai going back to PM as one of the manga's endgame? he seems really endlessly intriguing to me and im curious to hear your thoughts, thank you for taking the time to read!!!","reply":"i did an analysis that *kind of* goes into this you can read it here: https://twitter.com/eu_gi_oh/status/1258979952159895552?s=20&t=-vtokXSnklHmMhjKgjF3mw. basically dazai's morally gray. he's on the side of the angels but we shouldn't mistake him for one. but that can be applied to most of the characters in bsd (even the ones in the \"good\" side). and i think that can be even extended to IRL people. good/bad is black and white thinking; i believe more people fall under the \"morally gray\" category. you're right that the ada has a strong sense of justice, but i think dazai has one too, as well as loyalty and devotion. it depends on how you look at it. no, i don't think dazai going back to the pm is or should be happening. (asagiri already made him the boss in beast, so why would he do it for the canon timeline?). i don't want to necessarily say he 'belongs' in the ada (where do we all really belong huehue) but he is much happier there. and at the end of the day that's what matters.\n\nby contrast, i think speculating on what his heart's intentions are isn't too important. first off, he's a fictional character. but also, to quote his IRL counterpart, \"no two human beings understand anything whatsoever about each other.\" we can never know someone's intention but we can examine people's actions. at least that's what my therapist tells me: \"stop worrying about what you think, focus on what you do.\" and what dazai's doing is trying, which isn't perfect, we know, but it's most definitely not just nothing","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}}],[{"type":"post","post":{"id":1292532702,"likes":0,"timestamp":1663842277,"seconds_elapsed":63733844,"comment":"can u tell bea i said hi","reply":"she just grunted","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1292515951,"likes":0,"timestamp":1663840197,"seconds_elapsed":63735924,"comment":"if skk were to get together in canon, how do you think it would go?","reply":"i honestly think nothing’d change. or at least nothing should change. skk’s big appeal (for me) is that their dynamic’s already There and it wouldnt make sense for it to suddenly change bc theyre “official”. plus bsd’s not abt romance and any deep meaningful relationships it explores already speak for themselves, so im actually really content with skk as they are and i forget theyre not “canon” a lot of the time bc in my head they are. so yeah i dont think anything’d be different i think skk will act exactly as they are acting around each other now","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1292440293,"likes":0,"timestamp":1663839968,"seconds_elapsed":63736153,"comment":"have you ever bitten one of your dazai mochis?

I’m not saying his progress is reverted or that he’s regressing it a way, it’s hard to explain what I mean without sounding that way hehe, but I just feel like him being separated sorta something just is off because he’s grown so much now to just murder a bunch of guards (taken out but I assume murder hehe) but I also want like angst between him and atsushi (I don’t ship them or anything 😦) after that I DUNNO!! That whore needs to suffer for sec…. But I hope you can follow my ramblings I’m not 100% on my feelings ab him “regressing” or whatever in away but it crosses my mind a lot! So I was wondering if you had any opinions on it and what not :D","reply":"he's been in prison alone with a white person as his cellmate nobody comes out of that completely okay, ngl\n\nabout him supposedly killing the Mersault guards, yeah, it's possible he just took them out and not killed them. idk what to think about it since the english translated manga hasn't caught up to that part yet so i can't analyze it the way i want to, but i don't think it's necessarily a \"regression.\" for one thing, those guards aren't completely innocent, they're trained killers and government agents meant to 'deal' with dangerous Gifted. another thing, the entirety of dazai's plan hasnt been revealed yet. hes very predictable in that hes unpredictable -- meaning that what he *seems* to be doing on the surface is almost always subverted by his \"real plan all along.\" so its increasingly possible he's playing a kind of role or facade. third, he hasn't been 100% away from the ada + outside world; he can communicate w ango and he knows, from a strategic outlook, what's generally going on. but yeah, like i said, his situation isn't the best for anybody's head. people need people, dazai's not immune to that. id be more surprised if the prison experience *didn't* change him in one way or another psychologically-speaking (although he *did* go underground for 2 years post leaving pm, but we don't know if it was a \"hiding in a bunker\" situation or if he had some privileges)","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1292290621,"likes":0,"timestamp":1663689238,"seconds_elapsed":63886883,"comment":"sorry if this is too personal so you definitely don’t have to answer this i just wanted to know if others experience this too. when it comes to eating disorders do you ever have that day when you feel so incredibly full from just one meal to the point that it like kinda hurts but for some goddamn reason your brain is going “eat eat eat!” LIKE I CANT!!! but i do anyway cause i listen to my brain and i end up not eating for like. two days after that.","reply":"yup! there was a significant point in my teen years where eating one slice of bread made me full even though everything else was telling me \"eat more!!\" but it physically made me want to vomit. this isn't universal, but in my experience *trying* to eat food is like trying to stuff your mouth with cotton?

and they enjoy it ? it’s not hard and they can eat three meals a day np its even something they look forward to ? wtf\n\nhow i cope with it is reminding myself progress isnt linear. one day i could eat 3 meals easy and then not eat again for over 48 hours. thats okay. that doesnt change the fact that you ate the 3 meals, and you probably will again. it’s not going to stay like this forever; since you *know* you have the ED you are gradually changing in ways you dont quite see yet. for example, i used to go weeks without eating anything except coffee and junk food when i was in hs. i could go days without anything in my stomach. but now im 22 and ive been feeding myself enough over the past few years that i cant even go more than a day without at least having one snack and drink. over time ive trained my body to alert me more of when i need to eat.\n\ntherapy also helps. i have a dietician/nutritionist and all we talk about is food which is boring to me but she really really cares about my thoughts on pasta, so ig i’ll take her word for it. she doesn’t get mad at me if i mess up and skip meals, so i try not to get mad at myself either. she also told me i can eat whatever i want. like, sure, eating healthy foods like veggies and fruits are good, but diet culture and the beauty industry’s blown the necessity way out of proportion. youre already struggling to navigate eating so when you do eat, eat what you want, yknow? who cares if its cake for breakfast. or eggs and bacon at 3 AM. just as long as youre eating.\n\none last thing: remember you’re not alone, remember you’re not broken, and remember it’s okay to just exist. a lot of EDs come w their own baggage like anxiety, depression, body image issues. you dont have to always love yourself or feel great that youre idk eating a microwave dinner instead of a homecooked meal. body neutrality is incredibly important. have the patience w yourself to say “i am struggling right now, and im not happy about it, but it is what it is.” dont blame yourself. dont try to be an inspiration. just exist as you are and keep going. you’re doing just fine","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1291940247,"likes":0,"timestamp":1663384056,"seconds_elapsed":64192065,"comment":"idk why you wouldnt put a tw on your answer?

I was wondering if you knew of any guides on how to make good teams in the game in general?

i know it's super scary, but one way I've made friends from uni is that I just wait until someone cool comes along (i.e. someone presents on a topic I find really fascinating or somebody's randomly in the halls with an FMA shirt on) and I force myself to go up to them and talk. you might not get like the most life changing friendship ever out of it, but it's more possible when you put yourself out there. i know this is really hard for people w social anxiety, ofc, so remember to be patient w yourself too if you have it","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1290960993,"likes":0,"timestamp":1662669948,"seconds_elapsed":64906173,"comment":"hey eu, are you gonna stop uni after the master degree?","reply":"mmmm i dunno. might get my phd. might publish a novel. might kill a billionaire. we shall see","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1291003312,"likes":0,"timestamp":1662669880,"seconds_elapsed":64906241,"comment":"my achievement of the day is getting a \"mori dicksucker\" title after telling someone who was complaining that Elise is always with Mori on the mayoi cards that shes his ability so she is in a way a part of him","reply":"thats like complaining demon snow is always w kyouka even though shes her ability. that being said though, itd be cool if elise had a card of her own in mayoi","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1290954653,"likes":0,"timestamp":1662669790,"seconds_elapsed":64906331,"comment":"helloooooooooooo dear author!!!!!!","reply":"hellooooooooooooooooo :3","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1290937931,"likes":0,"timestamp":1662604160,"seconds_elapsed":64971961,"comment":"thank you! also, do you usually wait until a psychologist refers you to a psychiatrist or do you find one yourself?

Le Guin quote on Twain very helpful in reading classics - \"The childish point of view and the child’s point of view aren’t necessarily the same thing. A good deal of Tom Sawyer is a rather uneasy mixture of the two, but Huckleberry Finn, though narrated in a boy’s voice, has nothing childish in it. Behind Huck’s limited vocabulary, perceptions, and speculations, his ignorances, misconceptions, and prejudices, is the steadfast, lucid, ironic intelligence of the author, and it is through that intelligence that we understand and feel Huck’s moral dilemma, which he has such difficulty understanding himself.\nWhen I read the book as a kid Huck’s age, I understood that, as well as anybody under eighteen understands irony. So I could read with understanding even when shocked by some of the language and events—until I came to the episode where the boys, at Tom’s insistence, imprison and torment Jim. There I saw the black man I had come to love powerless in the hands of the white children, his fear and grief and patience ignored and devalued, and I thought Twain himself had joined in the wicked game. I thought he approved of it. I didn’t understand that he was satirising the cruel mockeries of Reconstruction. I needed that historical knowledge to understand what Twain was doing: that he was honoring me by including me in the same humanity with Jim.\nThroughout Huckleberry Finn, the boy’s unquestioned assumptions (which are those of his society) and the author’s convictions and perceptions (which are frequently counter to those of his society) contradict each other deliberately and shockingly. It is a profoundly complex, dangerous book. Those who want literature to be safe will never forgive it for being dangerous.\"","reply":"i haven't heard this quote so thank you for including it. mark twain wasn't ~ the best ~ for \"honoring\" black people and the anti-slave/Reconstruction movement that scene in huck finn is actually heavily dissected in a lot of decolonizing literature debates and academia tends to agree that, like, sure, mark twain was trying to do something, but we shouldn't overly praise him since that \"something\" has a looooooot of racist undertones in and of itself.\n\nrelating back to anon's concerns, yeah, as Le Guin says, historical knowledge and critical thinking (i.e. just bc the author writes about it =/= they support it, etc.). you're never gonna get a \"pure\" or \"completely unproblematic\" literary experience bc the subject just doesn't prioritize that. literature's always been a sociopolitical and philosophical outlet for people's beliefs and, as a reader, we need to take great care in reminding ourselves that nothing is ever surface-level, black-and-white, etc. it's all very complex, and it's okay to have a complicated, not-totally-happy-with-this relationship w the text","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null},"in_response_to":{"id":1290908296,"likes":0,"timestamp":1662588688,"seconds_elapsed":64987433,"comment":"so I started reading old classical literature because of bsd, and since I’m new to those I have a hard time dealing with their extremely problematic actions… how do u enjoy them despite that?

TedEd has this great playlist for literature which gives you good basics on what you 'need' to know before you read a certain book, like Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami or Virginia Woolf's To The Lighthouse. This playlist, however, is really limited, but there are tons and tons of videos about all types of books all over the internet. John Green has great crash course videos on some of the world's most famous literature and history, so I recommend watching him as well!\n-/you are smart enough to understand/. that's the most important advice i can give. just bc you feel like you're lost doesn't mean you are. books are really hard, dense, and complicated, thats why we study them. you yourself and your perspective -- no matter how much of a 'beginner' you are -- are contributing to this vast scholarship of knowledge by making your own observations, notes, and annotations. sure, there's always room to improve, but never /ever/ tell yourself you're not good enough to do this. you are!

do you have any thoughts on dazai and akutagawas relationship/dynamic?","reply":"i have a very unpopular and strange opinion of them bc how i view them is heavily influenced by their IRL authors. lemme explain. so in actual literary history, it was IRL Osamu Dazai who really looked up to IRL Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, not the other way around. And when I say 'looked up,' it barely covers how much Dazai really loved him as a writer. Especially when he was younger (a lot of his juvenalia makes references to Akutagawa, some subtle; some not). They never met or exchanged letters, but when Akutagawa killed himself in 1927, Dazai was devastated. He was 18 at the time and, when he heard the news, he neglected his studies and spent money on stuff his family didn't approve of. (He even joined a communist/Marxist group around this time lol which was *not good* in late 1920s Japan). Anyway, it was ironically Akutagawa who \"inspired\" Dazai to attempt his first suicide 2 years later, but it didn't work out. (He'd succeed in killing himself, however, in 1948). Akutagawa remained Dazai's idol all his life; one of his biggest dreams was to get the Akutagawa Prize in Literature, which is a really big deal (even now), but he never got it. He even wrote letters to the prize selection committee (you can see it here: https://www.japanbullet.com/news/letter-by-japanese-literary-genius-dazai-pleading-for-akutagawa-prize-found) *begging* them to pick him for the prize bc he loved Akutagawa's works that much. Basically, IRL Dazai literally killed himself over and over for IRL Akutagawa. The things he went through and the trauma of his idol's suicide never left him and it was genuinely sad and brutal. So. In BSD, this dynamic is obviously switched around, but as a literature student I can't separate the IRL story from the manga's, so in a very, very, very selfish way, I almost think their relationship in BSD is understandable, as well as fascinating. Like I said, IRL Dazai never met or even talked to IRL Akutagawa, but he went through so much hell always chasing after his hero his entire life, and it's sad, so seeing the roles reversed on BSD kind of feels like a sort of 'revenge' for IRL Dazai, I guess. That's not the right word, but you get what I mean. Ofc I don't blame IRL Akutagawa directly for all Dazai did and felt but their story just breaks my heart y'know? In a weird way, it's almost satisfying (to me) to see BSD Akutagawa be the one who looks up to Dazai.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1289803809,"likes":0,"timestamp":1661825489,"seconds_elapsed":65750632,"comment":"With Chuuya gone, will Dazai begin to self harm at some point?","reply":"spoilers !! but in peach flower boy dazai is already self-harming with the constant scratching, thats why hes had the bandages on since he was a little kid. but with chuuya gone it might get worse. who knows.

a story's never just about its ending! you ignorant fool! a book is an experience! just because you know youre going to have to shit everything out after a really nice meal eventually, you're still gonna enjoy your food! because the end result isn't the point! \n\nso really, in regards to introductions, it's all up to you. a lot of the time i read introductions *after* im finished the book so i can reflect more on the story, since introductions are mostly just really, really smart people who *already* read it analyzing everything in hindsight, so if they read it first without that intro, youll probably be fine. except when you wont and you feel the need to read the introduction first. it's all your call, dear Reader","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

What are your thoughts on this?","reply":"the term 'genderbend' is extremely dumb bc it recalls the nonexistent gender binary by which male and female are polar opposites you can 'bend' or twist however you want bc there are supposedly only 2 genders that are one-dimensionally malleable and therefore easily categorized by the absolute fact of the other. but masculinity and femininity are **not** exclusive to male or female; for example, a person can have masculine or feminine characteristics/aesthetics, but whichever gender they do/don't identify with is up to them, *not* their genitals, reproductive system, or what gender they were assigned at birth. biological sex =/= gender. so yes 'genderbend' is problematic bc it's just a trans-exclusionary term, but people creating a 'fem' version of an 'amab' character (i.e. dazai) opens up the chance of interpretation to trans + nb + people who view gender as beyond the girl/boy dichotomy. ofc, a big chunk of turning characters like dazai 'fem' is mostly motivated by horniness or, at the very least, aesthetic purposes, but thats valid to an extent. it doesn't have to be that deep. most of 'genderbend' is fueled primarily by horniness too -- moreso, since the 'genderbent' process is so hyper-focused on genitalia and over-sexualization (why does the 'genderbent' version of a male character immediately have to be curvier, half naked, and have enormous tits? that isnt even about gender anymore it's about a lot of things you can unpack, like misogyny). basically, gender and sexuality are difficult concepts that mean differently to different people, and sometimes could even mean nothing at all, so just let the people have femzai.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}}}],[{"type":"post","post":{"id":1289502350,"likes":0,"timestamp":1661556526,"seconds_elapsed":66019596,"comment":"How does someone recognize that they have mental health problems?

You can just ignore this if you want.","reply":"if youve gotten to a point where you're worried about the validity of what youre feeling and constantly going back and forth between \"im sick\" to \"im not really sick,\" then you're sick. it is true: if you think you're faking or \"making this up for attention,\" then you're not. because that in itself is a big red flag that something's wrong. neurotypical + healthy people dont worry or even take much notice of their healthy mental well-being; you only notice it when it's gone.\n\ni know it's really tough to admit it to yourself, but just bc something's wrong doesn't mean *you're* wrong. and its even tougher to ask for help, but the sooner you realize whatever youre feeling isn't good and it *is* real, the better, because then you can seek out treatment. contrary to popular belief, you dont have to wait until it's /unbearable/ to ask for help. would you only go to a doctor if you knew you had a tumor bc it's making it physically impossible to even move without pain, or would you seek help as fast as possible once you feel an odd lump under your skin you can't exactly explain? even if the lump isn't causing you intense suffering, you notice it, it bothers you, and you cant just talk your way out of it. if you keep bottling and bottling everything up your brain is going to decide /when/ it's had enough, and i can guarantee you its timing will suck, so you may as well control it as best you can and let it out in an environment + context that youre more comfortable in. \n\nalso, remember that everyone in this life experiences some sort of 'mental illness' at some point in their lives -- whether through grief or chronic impostor syndrome, etc. -- so youre definitely never alone. dont believe whatever individualist bs you hear from anyone: humans *need* each other. that's just how we were built. there are people willing to help. youll find them. youre going to be okay.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1289445944,"likes":1,"timestamp":1661499330,"seconds_elapsed":66076792,"comment":"(Disclaimer: i too like femzai a LOT) I have heard from some that genderbend is problematic. What are your thoughts on this?","reply":"the term 'genderbend' is extremely dumb bc it recalls the nonexistent gender binary by which male and female are polar opposites you can 'bend' or twist however you want bc there are supposedly only 2 genders that are one-dimensionally malleable and therefore easily categorized by the absolute fact of the other. but masculinity and femininity are **not** exclusive to male or female; for example, a person can have masculine or feminine characteristics/aesthetics, but whichever gender they do/don't identify with is up to them, *not* their genitals, reproductive system, or what gender they were assigned at birth. biological sex =/= gender. so yes 'genderbend' is problematic bc it's just a trans-exclusionary term, but people creating a 'fem' version of an 'amab' character (i.e. dazai) opens up the chance of interpretation to trans + nb + people who view gender as beyond the girl/boy dichotomy. ofc, a big chunk of turning characters like dazai 'fem' is mostly motivated by horniness or, at the very least, aesthetic purposes, but thats valid to an extent. it doesn't have to be that deep. most of 'genderbend' is fueled primarily by horniness too -- moreso, since the 'genderbent' process is so hyper-focused on genitalia and over-sexualization (why does the 'genderbent' version of a male character immediately have to be curvier, half naked, and have enormous tits? that isnt even about gender anymore it's about a lot of things you can unpack, like misogyny). basically, gender and sexuality are difficult concepts that mean differently to different people, and sometimes could even mean nothing at all, so just let the people have femzai.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1289407070,"likes":1,"timestamp":1661493310,"seconds_elapsed":66082812,"comment":"i’m constantly thinking about fem dazai. just on my mind 24/7 like the bitch isn’t even paying rent. “fem dazai fem dazai fem dazai” is all i hear all day everyday. it’s a disease i am sick i need help. i mean that or it’s just my lesbianism slowly consuming my entire brain idk","reply":"im afraid femzai brainrot is incurable, anon, im sorry to have to tell you this but you are sick, there is no cure, and, like all of us also obsessed w her, you're fucked!","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1289398351,"likes":0,"timestamp":1661492972,"seconds_elapsed":66083150,"comment":"is there any way you take care of your mochis or are they just there going through the pain of existence with you","reply":"yes","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1289374039,"likes":1,"timestamp":1661457433,"seconds_elapsed":66118689,"comment":"Hello, eu!

THE THOUSANDS OF WELL WRITTEN FANFICS THAT ACTUALLY GIVE HIM A PERSONALITY AND ARE SUPERIOR TO THE ORIGINAL BOOKS IN EVERY WAY. i hate jk rowling but the way ff writers have taken her original material and turned it into real magic is amazing. even bigger fuck you to her bc most of these new creators are LGBTQIA+ and other minorities\n\nalso !!! the thing that sparked my utter loathing and hatred for jk rowling was this poem called “To JK Rowling, from Cho Chang” by Rachel Rostad: https://youtu.be/o6xU3mYY3Cw. it put perfectly into words how, even though cho chang was asian and i wanted to identify w her, i just couldnt bc rowling didnt write an asian person. she wrote racist stereotype after stereotype into an otherwise empty character and called it representation.\n\nJK Rowling is truly the worst. the more you look into her and her books + the worldviews she put into them the more you want her to just shut the fuck up and go to hell.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1288063545,"likes":0,"timestamp":1660509603,"seconds_elapsed":67066519,"comment":"weird question so no need to respond if you’re uncomfortable but does therapy actually help? cause i can’t do this shit anymore lol","reply":"it works but the same way chemo works on cancer. that's such a dramatic comparison but therapy's a lot like cancer treatment in that it can never kill all the things making you feel awful. and, like chemo, the process of 'curing' comes with its own hells, so in the moment you feel like absolute shit even when the cancer's leaving you. it's really messy, it's hard to predict, and a lot of the time there're relapses. on top of that, you never know if the cancer'll be gone by the time you're done the treatment, which sucks, and can give you a sense of hopelessness. but, and here's where it gets corny, all that suffering isn't for nothing, since, no matter how bad it gets, *you are fighting against the cancer* whether you feel like you are or not. therapy's a lot like that. you need to keep constantly trying to find the right healthcare advisors, treatment, and dose that works for you, since, like cancer, no two traumas are the same. it's different for everyone, there is no one-cure-fits-all. it is disheartening, i know. there are more days when i feel like i cant do this shit anymore than not either: im not saying thats not valid. im saying you can always try again, and again, and with each try -- even if it doesn't feel like it -- you're still moving forward. even if you never find the *perfect* therapy treatment or therapist, you're still taking steps to take care of you, and that's worth all the headache of filling out ridiculous forms for your psychiatrist or telling the nurse how much it hurts on a scale from 1 to 10. keep trying. know that even trying is enough.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1287978646,"likes":0,"timestamp":1660509000,"seconds_elapsed":67067122,"comment":"bsd tiktok is a disease i swear. i saw a post of someone calling chuuya a shit person because he refers to dazai as “mackerel” and, according to them, that means prostitute. 💀💀","reply":"thats dumb bc it isnt even an insult dazai *wishes* he was a prostitute we respect sex workers here go off queen extort that ass this pussy aint free","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1287955289,"likes":1,"timestamp":1660432144,"seconds_elapsed":67143978,"comment":"me trying to write a fic: i can’t do this i need eu’s big juicy brain","reply":"the big juicy brain in question wrote the line “It was winter though so when my dick did ye olde cum shot it kinda froze over the second it hit the porch\" so careful what you wish for lmao (im flattered though thank you <3 )","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1287954012,"likes":0,"timestamp":1660431994,"seconds_elapsed":67144128,"comment":"where do you usually get your book recommendations?

(unless your teachers are assholes and require you to remember something irrelevant like publication year or something). ofc you should know the basics of the plot, but that's what summaries like on wikipedia, youtube, and even movie adaptations are for lol just look up a synopsis and you'll most likely be fine. what you actually need to practice (NOT study) is finding common points of similarity between the texts you're meant to learn from. for example, if a poem discusses love, *how* does it accomplish communicating its perspective on love *through* its poetry, and then relate that to how a different text -- such as a novel or a play -- did it also. all of english is finding similarities/differences. once you realize that 'studying' is useless and let go of 'traditional' school expectations like forcing yourself to sit down and read + memorize everything while retaining nothing, you'll be all the better. who cares about what specifically happened in Act I Scene 3 Line 101 where the entire sentence is literally just a dick joke? english doesnt care about that. bullshitting is an art. pull things out of your ass and support it with 'evidence' from the text. most of the time you're gonna be onto something, trust me. good luck on your finals. school is a scam. books are cool but institutionalized testing is a form of human torture. fuck it all.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1287716295,"likes":0,"timestamp":1660335691,"seconds_elapsed":67240431,"comment":"do you know when you'll be able to update notebook 2 to ao3? 🥺","reply":"ill upload it once im done posting it fully on twitter just like w notebook 1. its not guaranteed but if i will post anything itll be either on Mondays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays. i know my updating’s quite slow (ive been traveling and doing school) so thank you so much for ur patience dear Reader 🥺","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1287688596,"likes":0,"timestamp":1660290179,"seconds_elapsed":67285943,"comment":"Do you have any skk fanfic authors/works that you would recommend?

do you have any\ntips/advice/recommendations when getting\ninto literature? ive recently found myself\nwanting to dive deeper into it :) hope your day\nis going well, i admire your way of analyzing and how you interpret things. it's actually one of the reasons ive become even more interested in literature hehe so also, thank you ☺️","reply":"-don't dive into the big scary texts immediately. take bite-sized chunks like short stories, poems, essays, plays, etc to get a sense of the writer's style. if i read war & peace first before some of tolstoy's short stories i'd be so confused \n-be patient with yourself if it takes you like a year to read the great gatsby you're still a badass and fitzgerald would be proud\n-unless you're a superhuman, classics *are* more difficult to read than 21st century books or texts. if it only takes you a day to read a 500 page percy jackson book but like a week to read an 80 page novella *that's okay. that's normal* don't compare your classic reading experience with your other ones that way\n-watching adaptations of texts before reading the original book often helps! for example, i listened to the les miserables musical *before* i even tried starting the actual novel bc that way i already have an idea of what the plot is, who the characters are, and aren't going in blind\n-when you (inevitably) find yourself frustrated or bored, don't force yourself to keep going you're more likely to pick up the book again if you just let yourself have a little break\n-get book editions with annotations, introductions, and other helpful information so you can get context and help while you're reading. i really like penguin classics' black spines books bc most of them have 'notes' at the back that you can consult if something doesn't make sense or if there's an outdated reference. take advantage of the help people've already offered!\n-listen to what other people have to say about the book and why they liked/didn't like it. it's good listening to other interpretations so you can further polish your own. bc of the internet and accessibility to scholarship, the world's literally at our fingertips so take advantage of all that free knowledge!\n-don't think you're better than everyone just bc you read the classics being pretentious about it isn't going to give you anything\n-use sparknotes, youtube, wikipedia, etc. fuck what your english teachers say\n-develop a sincere hatred for jk rowling","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

Do you have any tips on how to better understand classic literature? I read classic literature, but it can be hard to comprehend from time-to-time. When talking about it with others, they say that they refuse to read classics because they’re too hard to understand. Is there a way to combat this?","reply":"i answered this a while ago but my best advice is to not take it too seriously. classic literature can be intimidating bc of the heavy novels, 'big words,' and infamous reputations (im too scared to read Ulysses by James Joyce, but let's keep that between us shhh) but pretty much all of them are ridiculous. just because it's hard and not what you're used to doesn't mean you can never understand it. \n\ni always tell people reading shakespeare not to worry too much on getting the Elizabethan English (which is hard to understand by default, unless you're from the 16th to 17t century), but concentrate on *understanding* the basic meaning of a text. most of the time, one loooooooooong paragraph by shakespeare is just an overwinded sex joke. don't get too caught up in 'comprehending everything' (never try to do that it diminishes your experience), but instead, cling onto what you can pick out and reward yourself bc of it. once you accept you can't have much control over it, reading becomes really easy.\n\nalso ask for help! get books with annotations, introductions, and additional readings! watch videos explaining the text if you don't understand! use sparknotes! watch the movie adaptations! dig more into the context of books and why authors wrote it! i know that's extra 'work' but it really is rewarding in the end. there's a reason all of these classics are still beloved, read, and published to this day. human beings need stories, you will understand more than you think, i promise","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1284112375,"likes":1,"timestamp":1658011366,"seconds_elapsed":69564756,"comment":"Hey, just fyi — this person was Dazai anon who recently told Sun to slit their throat and has been harassing creators for a very long.

using the dictionary AND thesaurus will also help bc then you can learn what these “smart” words actually mean. i also recommend asking someone else (preferably someone well-versed and is used to writing) to edit your essays. nobody is immune to mistakes and it’s always good having a separate pair of eyes looking at your writing","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

He wasn't even in the Mafia. He was neither Mori's secret illegitimate child nor an orphan he'd adopted, and he certainly wasn't a medical assistant. No single word or phrase could accurately describe their relationship. The closest approximation would be bound by a common destiny.\n\nThat common destiny bound them together one year ago. Mori, the Port Mafia boss's personal physician, and Dazai who'd merely been brought in for care after a suicide attempt—conspired and carried out a secret plan: assassinating their leader. The man's final words had been nothing\nmore than a fabrication.”\n\n(directly copied from the official light novel)\n\nhow do you think this plays into the theory? i’m curious as to what you may think because i’ve only seen people use this as a way to disprove the theory.","reply":"\"he was neither mori's secret illegitimate child nor an orphan he'd adopted\" interesting words to say. asagiri's evoking the dynamic between a parent and child while at the same time disproving it. it *looks* like it's that kind of relationship, but it's not. dazai and mori *resemble* it, but not quite, which subtly aligns mori's role as port mafia boss *with* him being a sort-of surrogate father to dazai, which, in turn, could relate back to how dazai's biological father *was* the port mafia's previous boss that mori assassinated. if my theory's true, in taking the role as boss, he's also become a 'fill-in' for a parent in dazai's life. this passage also mentions how mori's the port mafia boss' \"personal physician,\" which is a pretty high rank that i'm sure wouldn't have lowered mori down to the 'bottom' where he had to take care of some suicidal brat. that seems like grunt work, plus why would the mafia even care if dazai lived or died if he wasn't related to the boss in some sort of way? the use of the word 'merely' here attempts to downplay this significance, and i totally understand why people want to believe otherwise, but i don't think it disproves my own thoughts on the matter. there's just something really, really fishy in this brief explanation and i cannot buy dazai being 'just some random kid.'","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1283203371,"likes":0,"timestamp":1657226541,"seconds_elapsed":70349582,"comment":"Hi!

i end up just repeating the prompt and the explain it. i’m sorry this was a super long winded explaination for a short question.","reply":"i have adhd too lmao. (good grades are not an indication of anything most people dont think i have learning issues bc i get top marks in all my classes too its bs and ableist thinking). the method you used is the most commonly cited essay structure and guess what -- it's wrong ! they only teach you taught so you can get a basic understanding on how to write essays but most teachers teach it so badly that it ends up confusing more than helping.\n\nim a writing tutor so i help people edit their essays a lot. many fall victim to this same problem so you're not alone at all. one piece of advice i gave one of my students lately was to remember an essay is you arguing *your* opinion. train your head to see it as something *you* control and not the other way round. for example, using that method you just mentioned of intro, body x3, conclusion:\n\nintroduction: (brief context or summary of what you'll be arguing) Bungou Stray Dogs by Kafka Asagiri and Sango Harukawa is a manga series that began its printing in 2015. Since then, it had become widespread and popular, with multiple fans across the world that have a high demand for ongoing content. The series was adapted into an anime, and its fourth season has just been confirmed last November 2021. (etc.)\nTHESIS: (*your* answer to the prompt) Bungou Stray Dogs is an underrated series and should get more attention due to its themes of hope (POINT 1), stunning art (POINT 2), and honorary tribute to some of the world's most beloved authors (POINT 3)\n^^ each point is a body paragraph. it's good to have at least 2-3 examples to support your body paragraph's topic sentence. for example, for POINT 1 i would use scenes from the manga/anime that demonstrate hope very well, such as when atsushi and dazai overlook the city of yokohama after defeating the guild in s2 despite how horrible the three-way war was, or in dead apple when all the fighting's over and the ada meet again after successfully protecting the city after a night of fighting a seemingly futile fight against their own abilities. then you transition to POINT 2 and do the same thing w different examples, then onto to POINT 3, etc. your conclusion can honestly just be your intro paragraph merged with your body paragraphs' topic sentences. i literally just copy paste the intro, all my topic sentences from each body paragraph, and then change a few words/edit some things out and that becomes my conclusion. \n\nwhen you remember an essay is you just expressing your opinion and backing it up, it becomes less intimidating. also the 5-paragraph method is dumb. use as many paragraphs as you want -- some can be short, some can be long -- what matters is you get your point across.\n\nalso if your school has resources, ask for a writing tutor with help on essays! they're free and theres no limit to how many appointments u can make. no shame in it at all!","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1282625338,"likes":0,"timestamp":1656815190,"seconds_elapsed":70760933,"comment":"hello, eu! i’m very curious about your writing process. how do you outline your stories? do you make it up as you go along?

I'm having trouble with that; I feel like one day I read a book and the next I forgot everything.","reply":"thats how i am too! here's the secret: forget about remembering! we make remembering (and therefore 'knowing') a story detail by detail so overrated when it's not. people tend to think you didn't really 'read' a book unless you can recall specific plot points, but i dont think thats true. i think there is value in just experiencing a book, putting it down, and moving on. it's okay if you forget what exactly happens in like 24 hours, that doesn't take away from the fact that, for a pocket in time, it was in your life and you experienced it. i don't remember every single thing that happens in frankenstein, but it's still one of my favorite books bc of how it made me feel. i loved it and thats what matters. if i ever *need* or want to remember something specific, that's what the internet's for! look up the plot summary, synopses, movie trailers even, etc. the magic of books is that they change over time. even if you remember *everything* that narratively happens (how boring), you can return to the story after like 5 years and it'll be totally different. books change! it's not your fault you can't memorize stories! you're not some ancient greek poet whose only job in life is to orally narrate the odyssey front to back! youre a person in the 21st century buckling under the pressures of capitalism and social expectations! we live in fast-paced times where remembering things has become increasingly difficult. reading in and of itself is hard to do sometimes so dont blame yourself if you dont recall everything and maybe zoned out a couple times. we can't remember everything bc we can't know everything; but nobody else who reads it will feel the same way you did while reading it. isn't that really cool?","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

(he was also asian-coded, but let's not worry about that rn). the creature has some of the best speeches and (critical) dialogue in the novel. they're not some hunchbacked, mute and muttering, brainless monster out of the golden hollywood era. they're extremely complex, just like a person is.\n\nugh! i love frankenstein. it's so good! what you should focus on while reading is just that it's so good! mary shelley didn't have to go that hard but she did and she did it for us","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1282435073,"likes":0,"timestamp":1656658196,"seconds_elapsed":70917927,"comment":"would you mind elaborating a bit more around what you meant when you said stories are who we are? did you mean it as in they're the reflection of who we are or they build who we are or something else?","reply":"both. as long as humans have existed (and maybe even before that) there have been stories. we were told stories before we could even read or write, isn't that ironic? we couldn't even understand most of what's being said to us but we listen with rapt attention anyway. it's one of the oldest forms of communication, legacy, and preservation we have. hence, hi- /story/. all knowledge is basically a story, and from it we create, interpret, believe, hope, honor, love, hate, and everything in between. \n\nernest hemingway once said something along the lines of writing (or in this case, storytelling) being like sitting at a typewriter and bleeding onto the pages. i believe there's truth to that. i think words, as finite as they are, and the things we craft from them -- poetry, essays, even comic books -- that bring forth new narratives that otherwise would never have existed in the natural organic world, are proof that we pour our souls into them. what are stories but the passions and turmoils we all endure? they satisfy the human need to make art, declare opinions, and connect with others. stories are what we are. what we are, are in our stories.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1282432759,"likes":0,"timestamp":1656657752,"seconds_elapsed":70918371,"comment":"Hi eu!!

(damage is inevitable, and sometimes even gives the book character, which is probably a truth we all need to learn to accept).\n\njust make sure where you're storing them is dry and clean. if you're putting them in bookshelves like most people, make sure to give them some dusting once a month or something. keep fire, water, and earth (like soil from shelf plants) away from the books. don't leave books near windows, heaters, pipes, fans, or doors. if you're ever in need of transporting them like for travel you can get a small tote bag that can 'cushion' the book(s) from all your other luggage materials so it doesnt get crushed or bent. same applies for when you're just on the go.\n\ni don't necessarily have a system for organizing books or anything. i keep my books on shelves, hatboxes, chaotic stacks around my room, and just lying around anywhere. don't get me wrong i do take care of them and try my best to keep them the way i first got them, it's just a book is usually tougher than it looks, y'know? so what if 20 of them have been holding up my desklamp for over a year? it's pretty solid.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1282400022,"likes":0,"timestamp":1656657193,"seconds_elapsed":70918930,"comment":"Hello EU!

Do you think season 3 of BSD is worth watching? I started reading the manga way back after season 2 first aired, and I started season 3 when it began, but I really hated how it butchered my so-far favorite chapter (39), so I just kinda dropped off it... Now I'm trying to get back into the series as a whole, since I have a lot to catch up on, and I'm wondering if I should finish the anime before continuing on with the manga or not... What are your thoughts on season 3?","reply":"i certainly think it's worth watching, but if you're worried about the anime not portraying a lot of details from the manga chapters accurately or deleting them altogether you might have to take it with a grain of salt. i totally feel you though there were a bunch of things from the manga that the anime simply just cut out or changed and it was a little disappointing. season 3 especially follows this vibe a lot, i have several critiques on how they went about it, but at the end of the day im grateful for the bsd content. the animators who made s3 worked really hard to make the show in such a short amount of time so i still really appreciate it. my fav characters are back on screen and they're moving, what more can i ask for??\n\ni think you should read the manga first and then watch season 3. i wish i'd done that bc then i wouldn't've been confused in the anime. if you haven't already, also read the Fifteen light novel. they *really* reduced that story in the anime and its so much better in the original text","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

It’s beast dazai who’s talking, and it’s 16 dazai to be specific, he never met the ADA so why saying “i was helped by them in the past” when could have said something like “i’m sure they would help you” He was talking as if he lived that himself, it’s as if it’s canon dazai who’s talking, i don’t know if he created beast universe for real (even tho I completely believe he would creat countless universes for oda if he can) but he DEFINITELY lived all of those lives and experienced the joy of befriending oda and being by his side and also experienced the pain of loosing oda over and over again, it’s like all of the dazai’s from all the universes become one, and it’s beast dazai","reply":"i think beastzai is no longer mortal in the way that he has memories, knowledge, and information regarding timelines and alternate universes that he himself did not corporeally experience. like you said, it's as if all multiverse dazais converged into beastzai and he became the summation of all of them rather than his one self. obviously this triggers a paradox, and dazai, who asagiri described as having the mind of a 2000 year old man, is the eye of the storm. more than anyone else in beast he was the most unstable, as if even just him existing was *wrong* and fucking with time, -- all of reality, really -- so when he died and said he *had* to die at the end that made total sense. he didn't tell SSKK everything he knew when he saw the book, just that it's sort of forbidden knowledge that only a handful of people can really know about. it's very evident that beastzai has transcended earthly vestments; he's reached a sort of 'nirvana' or enlightenment state where he knows too much and his psyche is extremely fragile because of it. that's why, in the instance of side b (though i haven't read it in full), dazai can exist in parallel yet also divergent from the realities we know to have happened in the canon timeline -- he can remember the future and predict the past; he sees everything past chronology, euclidian physics, and linear time. and, as you said, it has very much quite fucked him up so bad","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1280202160,"likes":0,"timestamp":1655316465,"seconds_elapsed":72259658,"comment":"(dif anon) honestly idk where did people get the idea that canonzai wrote this book bc in beastzai final moments he shows that he got his hands on the book and because of NLH he nullified it so he saw through “the other side”, the only other world that exists inside the book, which to me implies that they’re both “the canon” and every other one is a variation of them so that’s why beastzai saw him specifically. however, i must say that there are so so many questions regarding the book that i’m not even sure whether they’d be addressed in the future (in the manga) or asagiri sensei just didn’t think it through thaaat much about it or doesn’t want us to? it is fascinating, how we have so many novels dazai-centric yet we know close to nothing about him -the real him-. sorry about this long ass cc lmao btw i love your writing so much 💘💘","reply":"i think ppl often go w that idea maybe bc of translation issues. i remember when BEAST hadnt been translated by Yen Press yet and there were several translators who mixed up some of the plot points in the LN, which I dont really blame them for since it’s all so confusing and it’s difficult translating something by yourself.

Hope this helps and that you enjoy Jane 🥰🥺","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1278929728,"likes":0,"timestamp":1654470844,"seconds_elapsed":73105279,"comment":"Hypothetically, do you have any Pinterest boards for your fics (very specifically CIHY dazai outfits)","reply":"i dont have any but my good friend made a Pinterest board for CIHY, which you can check out here: https://pin.it/463OVoF","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1278911660,"likes":0,"timestamp":1654411860,"seconds_elapsed":73164263,"comment":"ohh, it’s a beautiful name and eu is a cute nickname also. anyways, have a good day :))  i love your writing so much, it’s always so touching but fun to read at the same time ❤️","reply":"have a good day too 🥺🥺💙","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null},"in_response_to":{"id":1278859442,"likes":0,"timestamp":1654406916,"seconds_elapsed":73169207,"comment":"i’m brazilian so when i saw your acc in the tl for the first time i was like “hmm wonder what’s her name” bc i thought of osa-me/i lmao","reply":"my full name is eunice-grace but i prefer going by eu on here but osam-me/i sounds good too lol","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null},"in_response_to":{"id":1278837361,"likes":0,"timestamp":1654376525,"seconds_elapsed":73199598,"comment":"did you know that your name means “i” or “me” in portuguese?

Personally I think the reason why Dazai has that childish persona, in addition to the above,  is because the one thing he hates the most is being manipulated, so acting like a child, being ignorant and being resistant to doing regimented work makes it a lot harder for people to control (manipulate) him. I've not seen many people talk about that potential side to it so I was wondering if you felt similar towards why Dazai has that childish persona?","reply":"I think it's both. On a psychological level it makes sense that Dazai's more childish at 22 as a result of not having been able to experience a healthy childhood, but I also always found that part of him to be an allusion to IRL Osamu Dazai's inability to really relate to people. In No Longer Human, Obo says, \"I have frantically played the clown in order to disentangle myself from these painful relationships, only to wear myself out as a result.\" Meaning he pretends to be a fool so he could distract everyone from seeing he can't understand them. I believe BSD Dazai does the same thing, as during the few times we do see him by himself -- without the masks and bravado -- he seems really tired. His 'clowning' keeps him apart from a lot of people too, since a large reason why everyone finds him so unreadable (and therefore an enigma) is because one moment he's this bratty layabout, and the next he's just not. He knows it confuses people and he uses it to his advantage -- probably in ways he isn't even aware of himself. You're also right in that he uses it as a sort of defense mechanism to shun responsibility and make others assume he's just lazy and stupid. Dazai's really good at downplaying himself and only rarely reveals his real intentions/feelings. So, to answer your question, I think it's a mixture of all of these factors. It's again why he's a really well-written character.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1276452453,"likes":0,"timestamp":1652999815,"seconds_elapsed":74576308,"comment":"hello ! i was wondering where you bought your giant dazai mochi from?

i had a few questions abt being a lit major since its the field im planning 2 go into, id love 2 hear ur answers !! im currently abt to go into my first year of hs (10th grade) but where im from u pick what field (humanities VS stem) ud like to go into in 11th grade !! do u feel like theres anything u couldve done to help u be better prepared for uni/are there things that a hs student can do to make it easier in uni? do u feel its more challenging than other majors? and this question is for u As A Person, who r ur top 3 classic authors? thats all, hope youve had a wonderful day so far <33","reply":"thats really intense but it seems like youre really excited for your decision so first of all: congrats on picking a major! i had zero idea id end up where i am now when i was in grade 11\n\ni don't think there was really anything i could've done to help me be better prepared for uni. in fact i kinda wished i cared a little less about my academics back in hs. something ive realized is that you should prepare for not being prepared. you can read as many books as you want and type up practice essays or analyze poems but, at the end of the day, you're going to school to *learn* no prior experience required. that being said, if there was anything i'd say that helps is reading and writing. as much as you can. they go hand in hand. the more you read, the more you write and vice versa. and consuming stories is the best way to adjust to a lit degree, i believe. tbh it's one of the only things that's kept me sane during my entire degree.\n\nliterature's definitely challenging if you dont like it. i am biased but, when i was majoring in biology, i found i could still force myself to do assignments and still more or less function. but humanities degrees are built on passion -- it's a double-edged sword bc on one hand you get to do what you want but you also have to do what you want out of obligation. like with any degree, ofc it's a challenge. but i think it is especially challenging in a way a STEM major can never really replicate. you can teach someone step by step how a brain operation works but you can never tell anybody how they should feel after reading one poem. with literature, a lot of things are subjective, relative, and unpredictable. be prepared to be challenged, have your mind blown, to listen to other perspectives, and, most importantly, to learn to communicate your ideas. *so much of a lit degree is literally just trying to put into words what you already know in your heart but can't totally articulate.* \n\nand, for your last question, i really don't know there're so many good ones. the author i read the most is agatha christie, but my favorite book (anna karenina) was written by leo tolstoy. and some days my favorite book changes like \"oh hey i really *really* love mary shelley and frankenstein rn\" and that's just kinda how it goes the entire time. like i said: very chaotic. objectivity isn't real. you know more than you think you do. and, my best school-related advice: nobody else knows wtf you're doing either, so don't be so hard on yourself","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

(quite a bit of them have a submission fee but i advice you don't spend too much). \n\nthat being said, publishing is a lot of work. i totally think you should get your stuff published obviously but pls don't be disheartened if it gets frustrating sometimes! publishing something *by yourself* on *any platform* is hard. you're literally playing both writer, director, producer, and essentially agent. i 100% suggest trying out online contests, the local magazine suggestion, and just small projects in general. you could also self-publish with firms that do that but i personally find them to take more from artists than they give. be cautious! your art is special and should be treated as such so don't settle for less","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1275338334,"likes":0,"timestamp":1652014218,"seconds_elapsed":75561905,"comment":"idk if you have titktok so i thought i'd share this video i found LMFAO https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMLWVdYTf/","reply":"im fucking screaming can i pls get a screenshot of the comments if its not too much trouble LMFAOAHUGFHOSD","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1275327590,"likes":0,"timestamp":1652005413,"seconds_elapsed":75570710,"comment":"Who gafff if he did kill them kunikida stole a car too?

 your response is so reassuring oml i have a summer assignment where we have to get thru the whole book n like do an analysis project and i was so scared abt the length. \nis there anything in particular that made it so good for u???","reply":"oh lord that's rough i wish you the best of luck. i loved East of Eden but i do not want to do a school project on it. even so, yeah i think it's a really amazing book. the length is pretty intimidating, i agree, and some parts are kind of dry, but once you start caring about the Trasks it becomes almost impossible to put the book down. i loved Steinbeck's use of allegory to the Book of Genesis in the Bible, as well as that iconic conversation between Adam, Lee, and Samuel discuss the Cain and Abel story just as the twins are in the background awaiting to be named. I also loved Cathy's/Kate's characterization; it was sexist, sure, I'm not denying that, she's just easily the most interesting character in the book. I loved Steinbeck's intense prose when he describes certain things and how he deals with the theme of love. Some of the writing is also just plain beautiful like \"“In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to be loved. Indeed, most of their vices are attempted shortcuts to love...We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the neverending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.” Isn't that just gorgeous? Oh, I hope you like the book. I also hope you love it outside of your school project since I know how working on something out of obligation can tarnish your appreciation for it.

In dark era Oda explains how them meeting at the bar lupin allows them to interact as equals and I think that really does push the narrative that more than anything they were simply good friends. Oda was without a doubt a source of guidance in Dazai's life but Oda would also often encourage Dazai's mischievous behavior (such as drugging their hotpot) and let's not forget he had no issue with Dazai drinking underage. This is all behavior which could be reasonably seen as fitting the younger and older brother dynamic this anon mentioned since there is typically a lot more variation in sibling relationships, but does not hold up as being any sort of father/son relationship. There's also a contrast in how Oda treats his kid's vs how he treats Dazai which could be chalked up to Dazai being older than them but I really don't think that's all there is to it.\n\nTLDR: There's no solid reasoning for seeing their relationship as any sort of father/son dynamic and even if it was Oda would have been a shit father figure, this sort of poor analysis of relationships is media is so annoying fr\n\nanyways sorry that was a lot and kinda poorly explained, also while I do think you're a little weird for shipping odazai the harassment this person is sending you really isn't warranted /gen","reply":"ya. its chill u think im weird btw","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

But if not,  do you think, for that brief time after Odas death that Dazai stayed with the mafia, that Dazai bothered with re-wrapping his eye or was he just like fuck it and showed up the next day an absolute wreck without it?","reply":"He might've just to keep up appearances, but, symbolically speaking, the fact that we never see him in that liminal time between leaving and not leaving is the whole point. To us, that moment when Oda rips the bandage off his eye *is* the defining moment when Dazai starts to 'see' beyond the darkness he's surrounded himself with all his life. Even if he put it back on the day later, the shift's already happened. That's why we don't really need to see the in-between stage. It's like in stories where the hero undergoes an irreparable trauma, like seeing a loved one killed in front of them and it changes them forever. After that, we don't normally get to see the mechanical and pragmatic processes of planning a burial, putting on mourning clothes, buying flowers, etc. it just *happens* bc we know showing that stuff doesn't really matter. What matters has already happened.\n\nEDIT: Would also like to add that another reason we don't see Dazai during that brief time he was still in the PM before he deferred is that it must've been a period of complete shock, numbness, and grief that Dazai himself could barely process. Those days must've been a blur and it speaks to how much he's lost, so it doesn't matter if he put the bandage back on or not the next day, bc in his mind there wasn't a next day, there was just the singular goal of getting out and fulfilling his promise to Odasaku","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1271139792,"likes":0,"timestamp":1649280320,"seconds_elapsed":78295804,"comment":"I think he wasn’t in the right mental state after the kids and the shop owner died, let’s not forget that he also got betrayed by one of his best friends and now he won’t be able to meet him again, and taking his backstory in account too, i do believe he was completely broken and thought that his past would haunt him and his life would never get better, as I mentioned before, I really do believe the kids and shop owner wasn’t the only reason he chose to die, but their deaths were his last straw","reply":"I think so too.

Not sure where but the whole oda vs gide was described as a double suicide, not to mention his last conversation with dazai where dazai asked him to wait “there must be more than this going on, you need to rely on something, it can be anything, you should wait and see what happens next, whatever that is, it will happen “ and oda replied with “there’s nothing more going on dazai, it’s all over for me, i only want one thing”.\nthis is just my thoughts but I guess the kids dying wasn’t the only reason he decided to commit suicide, but them dying was his last straw, it was hinted a lot that oda lived such a shitty life, before he become an assassin, and even after he quit, 14 yo oda mentioned that he was alone all his life and never wanted a friend nor a boss, but then he got jealous of ranpo when he saw how much fukuzawa cared about him, he also despise betraying and thinks of it as a fatal mistake, not to mention he doesn’t take the word friend lightly and doesn’t call anyone a friend easily, also the one line he said in side B “I feel empty. I am tired, wounded, betrayed by people and betraying people.” I think all of this implies how his life was full of betrayal, and how miserable and hard his life has been, and even after he quit, he mentioned in side A how his past continued to haunt him and he had to deal constantly with people who tried to murder him, but he couldn’t move houses bc the guilt was eating him alive and thought that he deserves this. so in the end when he thought he finally found the happiness he always longed for in dazai, ango and the kids, he lost it all, ango betrayed them, and now he and dazai would never be able to meet him again, the kids got murdered, and even his dream of living a peaceful life and become a novelist was lost, bc his life would never get better and his past won’t stop haunting him and bring him people who would destroy his life “the mimic and mori”","reply":"this is a good addition. i was actually thinking about all of these examples when i first got the cc but i didnt wanna type it all up thank u anon for doing that 🙏🏽","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1271069736,"likes":0,"timestamp":1649270826,"seconds_elapsed":78305298,"comment":"though dazai is very smart i feel like if he can't do smtg he's the type to give up in 0.2 seconds","reply":"me too","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1271051626,"likes":0,"timestamp":1649257253,"seconds_elapsed":78318871,"comment":"wait where was it said he left in the middle of a mission i can't rmb that :o","reply":"can’t remember the manga chapter or panel but akutagawa does say to higuchi in a flashback that dazai left in the middle of a mission without a word. akutagawa blew up a building to create a “beacon” that the whole city could see as a message to dazai communicating his anger over his abandonment.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null},"in_response_to":{"id":1271033667,"likes":0,"timestamp":1649256374,"seconds_elapsed":78319750,"comment":"so a quick question, when did dazai exactly leave the mafia? like i always throught that he left right after odasaku's death but like i keep seeing tweets and posts on tiktok that apparently say that (according to akutagawa) he left in the middle of skk mission?? which tbh i tried to fact-check on the wiki, and while it does say that akutagawa confirmed he did go missing in the middle of the mission, there's nothing more to it... like no chuuya mention at all.. just idk i always thought that akutagawa meant the middle of mimic incident instead of a skk one..","reply":"Neither. Dazai stayed around for a bit after Odasaku’s death and the Mimic incident bc we know Oda’s body was given at the very least a proper burial with a marked grave, which means Dazai had to have stayed in the PM, both to plan for that, and probably to wait for Ango to further erase his crimes. When Dazai did leave he left during a mission but Chuuya was never confirmed to have been on the scene or that it was especially an SKK-centric mission. Since Chuuya’s car got blown up the night Dazai left the PM and that made Chuuya drink the Pétrus bottle once he realized Dazai left, he must’ve been close by (not overseas  or too too far away), but it’s never been explicitly stated that Chuuya was there.

Dazai stayed around for a bit after Odasaku’s death and the Mimic incident bc we know Oda’s body was given at the very least a proper burial with a marked grave, which means Dazai had to have stayed in the PM, both to plan for that, and probably to wait for Ango to further erase his crimes. When Dazai did leave he left during a mission but Chuuya was never confirmed to have been on the scene or that it was especially an SKK-centric mission. Since Chuuya’s car got blown up the night Dazai left the PM and that made Chuuya drink the Pétrus bottle once he realized Dazai left, he must’ve been close by (not overseas  or too too far away), but it’s never been explicitly stated that Chuuya was there. If I were in Dazai’s shoes it’d be a bad idea to disappear while Chuuya’s on the scene anyway bc he would’ve most likely figured out something was up since they’ve been partners for so long","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello!

Hirotsu was kept in the dark and there’s no mention of the other esecutives during Dark Era. It seemed like it was a case Mori undertook on his own, with nobody else knowing all of his plans the entire time, not even Dazai, who was an executive by then, his demon protégé, and supposed to be his righthand man. So yes I think Chuuya vaguely knew but he didn’t know everything that actually happened that caused Dazai to leave until much later. When Dazai did leave Chuuya’s initial reactions were most likely anger and confusion—hence the Pétrus bottle—but you’re right he’s not stupid; he would’ve investigated deeper into the case and as an executive he would have certain access to different files and info that could help him piece it together. And, since Chuuya has also lost several friends during his time at the mafia, he must’ve made peace with Dazai leaving bc of Oda. Chuuya knew Dazai was friends with Odasaku and Ango. He would’ve figured out how his partner was feeling, and why he did what he did.\n\nAlso yes I agree with you about the middle ground thing. I’m leaning more towards 18!Chuuya following Dazai after all because Asagiri alluded to that exact scenario in an interview where he posed “What if Dazai had asked Chuuya to come with him and they both went to the Agency?” But, like you said, there’s really no way of telling","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null},"in_response_to":{"id":1270327301,"likes":0,"timestamp":1648848313,"seconds_elapsed":78727811,"comment":"im reading all your analysis so more questions keep popping up in my head anws i was reading the one about dazai missing chuuya sometimes, it's not entirely related but i was wondering do you think there is anything dazai could've said or done to get chuuya to leave the pm? considering his extreme loyalty and now that we know he had the option to leave multiple times in sb but didn't","reply":"I haven't read Stormbringer in full so I'm limited in my ability to answer this. The short answer is that yeah probably, Dazai could've gotten Chuuya to come with him to the ADA and leave the mafia. It'd be a breakdown of loyalty between the mafia and Dazai, but I think Chuuya would've left with Dazai if he'd known what Mori did to Oda. Dazai *may* have thought about bringing it up before defecting, but it's either he didn't want to put Chuuya in that situation, he was afraid of rejection, or by eighteen Soukoku hadn't been as close as they were before. They're still partners, but incredibly distant. That's how I see them develop over the years. At 15 they were inseparable, but Chuuya always made friends easier (see Stormbringer, Dead Apple, etc.) and Dazai's always been a loner, so the novelty of Chuuya wore away after a while and Dazai was back to square one with finding a reason to live/keep life interesting. That's why he became friends with Odasaku and Ango and clung onto them so much.

He's not touchy at all and he may never be completely comfortable with it, but he's definitely more so now than he was at the ADA","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1269846634,"likes":0,"timestamp":1648450489,"seconds_elapsed":79125635,"comment":"have you read the woman who had two navels?","reply":"yes! i haven't read it in a while though this made me want to reread it hmmm","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1269761150,"likes":0,"timestamp":1648450460,"seconds_elapsed":79125664,"comment":"what size are your fingernails i know this isnt corerct","reply":"my fingernails are eu sized","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}}],[{"type":"post","post":{"id":1269340398,"likes":0,"timestamp":1648170729,"seconds_elapsed":79405395,"comment":"Hi hello can i just say im so glad you(and anon) mentioned having ADHD- for a long time i've suspected having it (or smth similar) myself and it can get really discouraging, but you sort of just single handedly restored my faith in myself😭 that sounds so overdramatic lol but i guess its just reassuring to know other ppl have the same problems and havent given up!","reply":"i know what you mean it's really hard living with it, i'm not going to say it isn't, but yes you're never as alone as you think you are. it's important to remind ourselves that just bc it's difficult and the odds are against us doesn't mean we still shouldn't try. :) thanks for the kind message anon","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1269337045,"likes":0,"timestamp":1648157780,"seconds_elapsed":79418344,"comment":"Ahaha!

I think reading some of the shorter stuff would be a good first step. Like I'm not even talking about the short novels like The Great Gatsby or No Longer Human I mean like short stories or even small poems. Bit-sized stuff that you could intake in one sitting. The caveat of that is that it's harder to hyperfixate/really like a short story or poem since they are in themselves short. People tend to have favorite books bc they carry more depth and quantitative content.\n\nSomething that could be helpful is immersing yourself in the pop culture/fandom of certain books *before* you get into a novel. Like you could watch movie adaptations or read up on the Wikipedia page of a book so you're not just jumping into it. Nothing wrong with that. That's what I do with a lot of authors I haven't read up on yet (like how I made friends with someone who really loved Dracula by Bram Stoker so I read it with her appreciation for it in mind). Surrounding yourself with people who already love it is infectious. ADHD also makes you feel really alone when you undergo things like taking up a book but it doesn't have to be!

But thank you for the very interesting and insightful reply, as always. My interpretation of his character is heavily influenced by the fact that I'm a psych major, I suppose, so it's really interesting to see it from your point of view, a lit major, how you read into things and the details I've probably missed, to create a better understanding, you know what I mean? Kinda unrelated but not really, this made me think of the scene where Dazai slaps Atsushi to get him back to his senses and how people often use this scene to show that Dazai hasn't changed and he's still abusive just the way he was with Akutagawa. And while I'm not trying to justify it (obviously), I believe this also relates to what you were saying. We're just seeing Dazai being his maladaptive self, he has of course grown a lot in four years but this still shows how hard it is to correct your unhealthy/maladaptive responses, especially in crisis. Once he realized he couldn't get Atsushi's attention he had to think about the fastest way to get Atsushi to snap out of it and this is probably the first thing he thought of because it's his default response. Also, I absolutely loved what he tells Atsushi in that scene, especially acknowledging he has no right to take away his past before giving him advice, it was an amazing scene honestly. And on a more personal note, the line about wallowing in self-pity absolutely shook me the first time I read it, it may not be the best one in BSD but it's my favourite and I'm not going to lie it has played a big part in starting to change the way I see things when I first read it, I'm really grateful for it.

The feeling's mutual; multiple readings and interpretations of things from different fields are always appreciated here.\n\nI really loved that scene between them. I wouldn't even call the slap 'abusive' (in comparison to what Dazai did to Akutagawa), least of all proof that he hasn't changed since he left the PM. I think you're right in that it shows his maladaptive responses, but I also believe it showcases how his being 'in the light' is still a work in progress. He STILL sucks at comforting people, even if he cares about them like he does with Atsushi. When Atsushi's having the full-on breakdown, Dazai just looks at him like he's watching a movie play out. He temporarily dissociates from the situation because he deadass doesn't know what to do. The slap is an echo of his 'default' responses but it's also a marker of how much he still has left to go. If he had been 18 and it had been a subordinate of his in that situation, Dazai's dissociation and inability to comfort people would've most likely resulted in violence as a way to avoid the situation altogether. He doesn't run away from Atsushi's breakdown, but he is still very distant. I love what he tells Atsushi in that scene as well. It's definitely an underrated BSD line that people misinterpret. \"Don't pity yourself. Pity yourself, and life becomes an endless nightmare\" is given on the basis of experience. You realize Dazai's been in the same situation as Atsushi multiple times -- hence why he recoils from acknowledging it in other people -- and that his words are actually personal. It's genuine advice from somebody whose been through it too. And he's right. Atsushi's only been able to productively deconstruct and figure out his trauma after he left the orphanage, so he's very new with coping with these difficult feelings and memories. Dazai isn't. Since we first see him at 14, he's dealt with his own demons and learned a thing or two that he can bestow onto the next generation.\n\nAnd lastly, my favorite quote from BSD is the line Dazai gives to Kyouka when she claims she's not fit to live in the world of light: “[Y]our anguish isn’t yours alone. What should one do when what they want to be isn’t what they’re best at? Everyone fights, searching for the correct way to live their lives. What do they seek by fighting? How ought they live?

I think it's important to consider that there is this stereotype that mentally ill/neurodivergent people have low levels of empathy and aren't as capable of feeling remorse or guilt in certain situations due to the different ways their brains function, so that's why I'm hesitant to have an end-all opinion about this topic. That being said though, there is really no right answer. He's a literal gray point and he'll stay that way. PM Dazai was more likely to hurt others because that's what his toxic, violent, and manipulative environment drilled into him. At some point, your conscience -- especially since he was so young and had less agency in the mafia -- goes quieter and quieter when you're surrounded by all this misery. He can't beat them, so he joins them. I'm not saying he was 100% heartless back then (not at all now too), but he tried to be and was cruel because he had to be. And, since that was his life (assumedly he's been surrounded by the Underground his entire life even before he entered PM), it's his default and it comes naturally to him. It's about trauma and the mechanisms he's used to dealing with it. Everyone healing from trauma can tell you all about their defunct, unhealthy responses to certain things, and a lot of the time healthcare professionals will tell you it doesn't matter what you initially think or feel, it's how you react to it, and it takes a lot of time to develop that mindset. So basically, the extent he can feel for something + empathize isn't as important to note as what he actually does in terms of his actions. He's very much portrayed as a 'neutral' character a lot of the time, but his attempt to be a good person is meant to supersede his past. It's really complicated.

I can't find the original tweet that showed the pictures of my annotation examples, but hopefully it helps a little.\n\nSomething I'd add is that you shouldn't put too much importance on annotations. Don't get me wrong, they are very helpful but I know some people feel really discouraged when they go on for pages and pages without making a single note. That's okay! Nobody expects you to catch everything. (Where's the fun in that?). Annotating and marking up a book should be done to help your learning. Don't compare yourself to other people's work or judge yourself if you can't make much sense of a passage at first. Everything'll work out.

Everyone healing from trauma can tell you all about their defunct, unhealthy responses to certain things, and a lot of the time healthcare professionals will tell you it doesn't matter what you initially think or feel, it's how you react to it, and it takes a lot of time to develop that mindset. So basically, the extent he can feel for something + empathize isn't as important to note as what he actually does in terms of his actions. He's very much portrayed as a 'neutral' character a lot of the time, but his attempt to be a good person is meant to supersede his past. It's really complicated. Dazai's emotional psychology's pretty intense.

I can't even guess myself what it must be to live the life of a human being.”\n\n“Whenever I was asked what I wanted my first impulse was to answer 'Nothing.' The thought went through my mind that it didn’t make any difference, that nothing was going to make me happy.”\n\n\"I thought, 'I want to die. I want to die more than ever before. There’s no chance now of a recovery. No matter what sort of thing I do, no matter what I do, it’s sure to be a failure, just a final coating applied to my shame. That dream of going on bicycles to see a waterfall framed in summer leaves—it was not for the likes of me. All that can happen now is that one foul, humiliating sin will be piled on another, and my sufferings will become only the more acute. I want to die. I must die. Living itself is the source of sin.'”\n\n“He could only consider me as the living corpse of a would-be suicide, a person dead to shame, an idiot ghost.”\n\n“I have always shook with fright before human beings. Unable as I was to feel the least particle of confidence in my ability to speak and act like a human being, I kept my solitary agonies locked in my breast. I kept my melancholy and my agitation hidden, careful lest any trace should be left exposed. I feigned an innocent optimism; I gradually perfected myself in the role of the farcical eccentric.”\n\n\"He was a good boy -- an angel.\"","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1266028279,"likes":0,"timestamp":1646441542,"seconds_elapsed":81134582,"comment":"I mean, the main thing making me question the extent of his empathy is the way he feels/seems to feel about inflicting physical or emotional violence on others, so this is mainly about PM Dazai, but I felt like it could still apply to ADA Dazai sometimes. I do believe he's of course capable of empathy, he's shown it multiple times in the LNs, I just wonder to what extent and how much it actually bothers him —which, now that I'm writing about it, actually has a lot to do with how he deals with and feels guilt.","reply":"This is really tricky and I get why you're questioning it. I think it's important to consider that there is this stereotype that mentally ill/neurodivergent people have low levels of empathy and aren't as capable of feeling remorse or guilt in certain situations due to the different ways their brains function, so that's why I'm hesitant to have an end-all opinion about this topic. That being said though, there is really no right answer. He's a literal gray point and he'll stay that way. PM Dazai was more likely to hurt others because that's what his toxic, violent, and manipulative environment drilled into him. At some point, your conscience -- especially since he was so young and had less agency in the mafia -- goes quieter and quieter when you're surrounded by all this misery. He can't beat them, so he joins them. I'm not saying he was 100% heartless back then (not at all now too), but he tried to be and was cruel because he had to be. And, since that was his life (assumedly he's been surrounded by the Underground his entire life even before he entered PM), it's his default and it comes naturally to him. It's about trauma and the mechanisms he's used to dealing with it. Everyone healing from trauma can tell you all about their defunct, unhealthy responses to certain things, and a lot of the time healthcare professionals will tell you it doesn't matter what you initially think or feel, it's how you react to it, and it takes a lot of time to develop that mindset. So basically, the extent he can feel for something + empathize isn't as important to note as what he actually does in terms of his actions.

I understand that showing him crying would be overcompensating, but he *does* get emotional a lot of the time. Yes, I was thinking about the sniper, curry shop, and funeral scene, but yes also that confrontation scene with Mori wasn't animated as well as it could have been. That scene was so important in defining their relationship because you really saw how heartless Mori is; he was even happy to use his right-hand man and protege's best friend for a business deal without consideration or a second thought. Dazai realizing that -- and eventually his panicked attempt to save Odasaku from the duel with Gide that ultimately failed -- should've been done with more emotional output, like he is literally 18 years old and just lost two friends and figures out way too late that the man behind it all is also his guardian and boss.\n\nAs for Fifteen I could go on and on the light novel clearly shows him in pain and voicing that pain. He doesn't cry, but he is literally a fifteen year old child his bones get broken he gets sliced up and beaten and *he makes it known* that he's hurt. I'm also not really one to bully animation studios much (I know the animators were doing their best and were already under enough pressure) but yeah as a watcher I was pretty disappointed.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1265208594,"likes":0,"timestamp":1645583039,"seconds_elapsed":81993085,"comment":"Not to be rude, but in bsd its STILL flipphone era","reply":"I do not see how that matters","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1265206822,"likes":0,"timestamp":1645582533,"seconds_elapsed":81993591,"comment":"Odasaku was alive in the flipphone era, emojis weren't a thing back then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, a waste of characters and a waste of money for these characters","reply":"You say that like I wasn’t counting the present are you trying to tell me Dazai wouldnt go to Oda’s grave and tell him about emojis and how the world’s gone on without him","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1265050932,"likes":0,"timestamp":1645493159,"seconds_elapsed":82082965,"comment":"Hello, I hope you're having a nice day!

No, Dazai did not die in Wan based on the fireworks episode and ending scene where Atsushi is at the river waiting for someone + crying. The end screen of the last Wan episode is of Dazai floating along the river, bumping against a log, and, after a struggle, coming back up for air and saying \"I thought I was dead.\" So he's still very much alive at Season 1's conclusion. Wan's supposed to be campy fun and wholesome. If anybody died that'd defeat its very purpose.

I hope you're having a nice day! I wanted to ask your opinion on a question I've asked myself almost since I started bsd. Do you think Dazai found Atsushi on purpose that first time at the river, knowing what part Atsushi would play in the future? And how important he may or may not be to find the Book? Oh, and now that I said that, I came up with another question! What do you think is the Book? Is it an ability? Is it an ability weapon like One Order or the other weapons I forgot about now but I'm sure were mentioned before? Or is it something else entirely? Maybe even sentient? What connection do you think Atsushi has to the Book? Is it his ability? Do you think his ability is more than a normal ability? Oh God, the questions keep on coming, I'm so sorry. Do you think abilities in general are more than we think? We heard about abilities getting transferred to other people, see Kyouka for example, so does that mean they're more than just.. idk. Insentient? Ahhhh I know that we don't have the facts to answer all these questions yet but I'm very curious about your opinions! I would also like to hear what you would wish for! Ahh I'm sorry this turned out so long ^^'' I hope you'll have a nice day! I loved your analysis of the new cover art btw, thank you for sharing!","reply":"No, I don't think Dazai planned on meeting Atsushi but I do believe the minute he saw him and realized he was a powerful Ability user that he'd be invincible with Akutagawa. The fandom has this tendency to assume Dazai knows everything that'll happen like some omnipotent god, but I think that undercuts how quick his mind processes setbacks and moves and recalibrates it back to his original goal. He does get surprised, and meeting Atsushi is one of them. I'm sure once Dazai put two and two together his stupid little bastard mind went, \"Furry orphan. Strong tiger. Win-win.\" Basically, I believe he saw his inner potential earlier than anybody did -- even Atsushi himself -- so yes I'd say Dazai knew, because of the nature of the world of Abilities and Yokohama's underground, that Atsushi would play a significant role alongside Akutagawa in the future, but I don't know for certain if Dazai initially planned on using Atsushi to get to the Book. There's significance between the white tiger/tiger beetle in relation to the Book that Fitzgerald mentions, but for now, we really don't know much. Dazai's character motivation isn't even specifically tied to finding the Book like Dostoyevsky is; he certainly knows about it but for now, I get the sense that even it confounds him.\n\nI don't know what the Book is. Not ashamed to say that. So much of Abilities and BSD's universe is so unknown right now. In the light novels when Asagiri tries to explain the science, mathematics, and execution of supernatural powers, it gets complicated real fast -- and, as we know, there're so many singularities and exceptions to the rule that Abilities are an anomaly all on their own. The Dark Era, 55 Minutes, and Dead Apple light novels prove that Abilities are so much more than their face-value appearance. Some are arguably their own separate being entwined with a user (like the Tiger with Atsushi), but it's really complex. Like a million flow charts level of complex. The Book could be an Ability, which would sort of make sense, but I hope it's not. I hope it's a twist that completely changes our perspective on BSD -- something nobody would've guessed.\n\nDon't apologize about the long cc!

It probably symbolizes how the entire duel with Fyozai was orchestrated by Nikolai, he seems to be serving as like an omnipotent godly figure observing the chaos he's ensued, but we all know that's not true. He'll be actively participating in the series at play since the very scene with Fyodor and Dazai below him are all *under* his overcoat, meaning his influence -- as related to his Ability -- doesn't just stop at Fyozai getting out of jail. \n\nThe actual Fyozai image is a classic duel image. It contrasts to the various references to game theory and imagery that Harukawa's played around with for them, such as the all-too-familiar arts with chess paraphernalia in them. The symbolism speaks for itself there: Dazai and Fyodor are playing this game with the other as opponents. Despite not being the actual leaders of the organizations they represent, they're still very much the brains and the strategists and the whole point of their dynamic is to see who comes out on top. That's why those two are elevated in the picture in relatively equal height and face-to-face, again referring to their being like mirror reflections of each other in intelligence. Their faces and smiles even look alike, there aren't many ways to distinguish between which is which because of this cover art. Notice how they're wearing the same prison clothes too, making them seem more indiscernible from one another. The Fyozai scene is also overlayed with a graph pattern overtop it and looks to be framed by a large, ornately decorated mirror. Again, the mirror imagery between Fyozai is present here (also Nikolai being the one resting on the actual mirror and looking down onto the projected image relates back to how I said he's pretending to be an outside onlooker, but that's not true). The graph pattern is interesting because it only overlays the 'mirror' area of the cover art and not anything else, which suggests it might not be a mirror it might even be a screen that Nikolai's controlling the viewer's perspective of. But mirrors as screens and vice versa are a common trope in literature so the distinction might not really matter. \n\nThe tarot imagery -- the cards, obviously, as well as the eye-in-the-sun symbol and diamonds reminiscent of playing cards and Nikolai's clown outfit -- are all a part of the game imagery. The diamonds looking like Nikolai's outfit also relates back to how he's a classic Joker figure, which has its own implications in card games and game symbolism. There are so many interpretations as to the eye-in-the-sun symbol and to be honest, there's really no 100% correct answer for that one, that's just my interpretation.

I’ve read excerpts of most of his literature—I can’t find a good copy of “A New Hamlet” 😕—but I’ve technically only read No Longer Human. I’ve reread it so many times it’s like I’m stuck on it.

If you want a Dazai recommendation though, my favorite short story by him is “The Story of a Pet Dog,” it’s hilarious.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1263215131,"likes":1,"timestamp":1644357896,"seconds_elapsed":83218228,"comment":"You’re not a fictional character 💀💀","reply":"How do you know that?

Chuuya makes note of it and so does Akutagawa. It's just *not* him, which makes his trying to be a good man more significant. It's *obvious* it isn't what he's best at, but it's what makes him happy, so it is the path he should take. It's really, really, *really* important that Dazai's a societal menace and overall piece of shit, ironically: it really attests to how he naturally *doesn't care if people think he's a good person or not,* but he is *trying to be a good person* regardless of if people take notice of it or not. And the clownery's a result of his coping mechanisms and trauma definitely, but yes I agree it is a gross mischaracterization of him to just assume he's 100% good or \"happy-go-lucky\" post-PM. That's not true at all.

To me, Dazai fundamentally isn’t a nihilist because he believes in things other than undiluted truth. He definitely thinks there’s a certain charm as well as frustration to life’s supposed meaninglessness, but over tjme (especially since leaving PM), his views have changed and become more mature. There’s really nothing attractive about nihilism as a core philosophy, and I’m sure Dazai’s smart enough to understand that. Like yeah sure, nothing matters, but it isn’t a heavy, heavy burden to him. Who cares about the grand scheme of things? What about the miniscule scheme of things? Everyday life? Everyday people? Wavering lost like stray dogs who’ve hit rock bottom? Of course it’ll all be gone, it’s technically all still pointless, but right now it’s here and he appreciates it.

(if you don't really know cioran's works, let me explain myself further, if you don't mind, i like rambling about dazai and you're kinda The Dazai Specialist™, Master's Degree in Dazai® so,,,) i feel like while cioran does believe in the meaninglessness and absurdity of life, he doesn't look at it with a pessimistic view, quite the opposite. like, one of the things he said that striked me the most is “the fact that life has no meaning is a reason to live —moreover, the only one.” in that sense he actually seems a lot more optimistic. also when he talks about suicide and says that “without the idea of suicide, i'd have killed myself right away.” i feel like that is really dazai-esque: knowing that life is just despair and loneliness at times but also knowing that you still have an escape at any moment, this pushes you to go on? another reason why i feel like dazai embodies a lot of cioran's philosophy is the way he disagrees with how society looks at suicide, failure, melancholy, existential dread, the endlessness of things and all the things that makes us uncomfortable. he suggests embracing this dread instead of running away from it and more importantly rationalizing it (via relativism, nihilism, religion, etc.), which i feel like relates to dazai. on failure, cioran admires people of are failures of society, brilliant people who do nothing, he actually presents himself as a failure when he was an awarded author during his lifetime. ultimately, to me cioran's philosophy is about running into the absurdity of life, accepting and loving life because it is absurd. aren't people who embrace and face every part of what it means to be human and living —the good, the less good and the dread— living more fully than other people? (hopefully this makes sense, i'm terrible at English-ing and explaining things 💀 and hopefully this'll make you more interested in cioran heh)","reply":"You are not terrible at Englishing, I'll have you know. Thank you for elaborating further, I genuinely appreciate it! With your explanation, I can say I agree with you. At 22 (like most people in their twenties honestly, myself included), Dazai's definitely just come to terms and accepted the fact that life is meaningless, but that's okay. Realizing it doesn't have to be this burdensome depressing thing.

Particularly in reference to whether or not the prestige of a college matter at all, especially for English majors? Also, I love your fics so much! :)","reply":"Thanks for reaching out! Everyone will tell you that a university/college's prestige matters, and to some degree they're right, but schools considered 'top class' tend to be pretty overrated. Especially in regards to Humanities. STEM and other majors are iffy because some schools definitely are more qualified and better to teach you than others, but generally, Humanities are very fluid. If you want to pursue English I say any place that has a relatively decent-sized English department (and a good library!) would be a decent fit. I'm not in a top university at all because I can't afford anything else, but I'm pretty content where I am and what I've made of the hand that I've been dealt with. I do admit I wish I had been able to go elsewhere since the English Department here is very small and not as diverse in options as somewhere like McGill or UBC (top universities in Canada for Arts and Humanities). I would say that's the only part of the 'prestige' argument you should focus on because it isn't about chasing status or bragging rights, it's about you considering where you want to go in your education and choosing an opportunity that best suits you based on your interests, not some ranking list that tells you to go somewhere just because it's fancy.\n\nIt's basic, but my advice would be to go to a school that would make *you* happy. That would make your college experience as exciting and educational as possible without draining you severely. Secondary school is always going to be difficult, yes, but if you pick a program and a school that you personally like, then it's so much better. Your happiness is more important than anything else.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1256256880,"likes":0,"timestamp":1639098595,"seconds_elapsed":88477530,"comment":"mn tu n cala a porra da boca na fanfic pqp quase me matei lendo parece scan de manga que fica botando opiniao onde n deve na porra dos paineis mas tirando isso ótima história adorei é incrível !","reply":"😅😅 Uh the Google translation of this cc makes it sound kind of aggressive but I'm gonna choose to focus on the last part more, so thanks for thinking my story's amazing","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1254744096,"likes":0,"timestamp":1639098434,"seconds_elapsed":88477691,"comment":"thank you! so, if i may clarify, teruko is arguing that if everyone is desperate and equal in that sense, then the ability users' desperatio outweighs the ordinary man because they have some sort of trump card (which is their special skill)? please do correct me if i misunderstood! this is quite a lot to take in but anything for bsd <3 \n\nalso, to follow up, may i ask how atsushi trying to save sigma shows his disagreement with teruko? is it because as you said, people with special skills act competitively and thus seek to save themselves first (dog-eat-dog), but atsushi doesn't do this? like he chooses to save sigma. does this make his desperation not meaningless, since he uses it not to save himself but other people as well? \n\ni'm really sorry for asking so much over a cc! i'd dm you, but i'm not on bsdtwt anymore and i am quite shy TT i'll stick to talking from afar for now!","reply":"Yes that's pretty much what Teruko's saying. \n\nAtsushi's philosophy is that one's desperation for meaning in life shouldn't compel you to bring others down, but rather lift them up. \"We're on the same boat doing this thing called living, so let's help each other.\" And it's not a wholesome, bullshit, happy-go-lucky kind of outlook either. It took so much violence for him to be this kind; and he does have to make an effort to be nice to people sometimes -- even with the ADA. Atsushi isn't naturally this considerate, empathetic person. To some degree he is, but it took work. It took time. \n\nBasically, if somebody says it's a dog-eat-dog world he simply refuses to believe it because if the world is going to be cruel, then he won't be. Because Dazai and the Agency weren't to him. They let him have a chance, so he sympathizes with Sigma when he doesn't want to keep going anymore.\n\n(Also don't worry about asking me stuff on cc.

I'm trying to make my thoughts coherent but i'm not really sure how best to do it.\n(I also have an aversion to writing in my books but i have a sneaky suspicion i should just get over that lmao)\nHave a lovely day💙","reply":"(Gonna use my personal notes + annotations as examples here sorry in advance for the shitty quality).\n\nSo I completely understand the aversion to writing in books, and I do agree that people put too much importance on them by thinking they should *never* rip up a book or scribble on it, but when it comes to cherished or expensive editions it's just not ideal. The best way to fix this is to get *cheap copies* of the literature that you want to annotate. In Picture 1, you can see how I just made a mess of annotations on my copies of Hamlet and Much Ado About Nothing because they were under $12 each, therefore I don't feel bad about writing on them. (If I ever tried to make notes on my $35 copy of Botanical Shakespeare that I got from the Philippines, it would be a different story). Annotations should be your initial thoughts and observations -- don't take them too seriously. Literally just go apeshit. You can gather your thoughts together in a 'brain dump' document later. In Picture 2, you can see my copy of BSD LN 2, and behind it are my manic post-rewatching Dark Era notes outlining an analysis I'm still working on. I took my annotations from the novel and converted them into a mind map so I could scrawl and connect them on-hand without making a big mess of my LN. You can do this however you want; sometimes I use a Google Doc and other times I opt for good old lined paper. \n\nOf course, you can also just skip the in-text annotations altogether and opt for just taking notes on a separate notebook like in Picture 3; those are the notes I took on N.K. Jemisin's Broken Earth series for my Decolonizing Speculative Fiction class. My copies of the books were all online, so I couldn't mark it up like with a physical book, so I just put general observations in a smaller notebook and that's what I consulted whenever I needed to look back on my initial thoughts on a passage or something. You can also go the very, very traditional way and just take notes neatly on a piece of loose-leaf paper, like in Picture 4. Those notes were for my Shakespeare Romances and Tragedies class; I also annotated the actual plays but those notes were good things to have on-hand and organized so I could refer to them just in case I was confused about something.\n\nThere's really no 'best' way to do things ever. It's a trial and error process. You will figure it out on your own, but don't be afraid to try different things! I've been doing this for years and I'm still trying to work out a lot of things about my literary notetaking!","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1253073584,"likes":0,"timestamp":1637657054,"seconds_elapsed":89919071,"comment":"Hello hi Eu!!!!

I absolutely love books and I enjoy analyzation of the text but I seem to be in some sort of slump (?) for about 2 years now (a really long time, I know). The thing is, that my head just never seems to cooperate while I try to read - it’s like I have a fog in my head and it makes it almost impossible for me to concentrate. \nI was wondering if you could give me some advice for this “slump”? Maybe some recommendations of books that you enjoy (I like your writing style and you seem like a very cool person so honestly I will most likely try to read anything you recommend because I will feel like I have to - not in a bad way tho dw)?\nAs I am in high school, it’s understandable that I need to pursue with my interest (in this case; books) if I am going to study it further in my life and as you may have figured, this kind of slump is just an annoyance :( \nCould you also please write more about your studies? I am interested in whats it like and if I am actually going to enjoy it. \nThank you and have a lovely day <33","reply":"If you love it, it will always come back to you. Two years isn't a ridiculous amount of time, it happens. Throughout my last 3 years of high school I hardly ever read for fun anymore. Life gets in the way, books will always be there for you!\n\nCongratulations on picking a major! I definitely didn't get that far in hs! I'm happy to hear you're passionate about what you want to study (that's the most important thing). I understand this \"slump\" or brain fog you're talking about. I always enter one at least once or twice a year and they're not very fun. It's hard to concentrate for me too! I actually can't read many pages in one sitting; I used to be able to as a kid but now I can't get past 20 pages without feeling tired. So you're not alone! I guess my only advice for you is to remember that this happens to everyone -- *everyone* -- whether they're in the literary field or not. You're still a reader and a lover of books even if you're not currently reading something sophisticated and analytical right now. And if you do end up pursuing lit in university, I'm sure it'll come back to you faster than you think. You'll be introduced to worlds of new literature and learn how to approach them with the guidance of your profs. So don't force it or worry too much. I know that's hard, but sometimes reassurance goes a long way. If you want some book recommendations from me, I'd say read The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It's my go-to book to tell people to read when they're in a slump like this and it's never failed. Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë, Anne of Green Gables by L.M. Montgomery, and Frankenstein by Mary Shelley have also been very effective, I find.\n\nFeel free to cc or DM me if you want more recommendations! Same goes for whatever you wanna know about my studies.\n\nThank you for your kind words about my writing :) Please don't feel pressured to read anything I recommend though; different tastes are good!","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1250675566,"likes":0,"timestamp":1636527335,"seconds_elapsed":91048790,"comment":"questions that could well be answered in a single cc (?):\n1.

I am not a booktuber but I'm sure if I ever tried to have a channel it'd flop immediately. I don't know how YouTube works, I can't edit videos for shit, and all the books I read are from dead authors that everybody's either read already or doesn't really want to read. I do give quick book reviews on Instagram after I finish reading something, but they're relatively short and pretty much just me rambling incoherently while anybody who has the misfortune to see it never know wtf I'm talking about ever.\n2. I have not read Sherlock Holmes completely but I've read excerpts! I have a beautiful collection of all the great Arthur Conan Doyle novels I got from Barnes and Noble when I went to Las Vegas a few years ago.\n3. Most difficult thing about having a literary career is how unstable and chaotic it is. There's hardly ever anything assured unless you become a famous writer, researcher, reviewer, etc. -- and even then you never know. It's very much a business you can't really get much financial assistance with unless you get fame or academic renown. But, to answer your question, it's one of those degrees that will take you to unexpected and beautiful places. It's amazing, really. For example, ages ago I read some of Osamu Dazai's passages/quotes by chance, and then -- also by chance -- I got introduced to Bungou Stray Dogs, and now I'm working to get my MA approved so I can do graduate-level university research for the series! Literature's unpredictable, but that's half the fun of it. You meet and get to know so many people. You get to see into a writer's soul, heart, and mind despite how they've been long dead. You become so sensitive and aware of the world around you, but what's so bad about that, yknow? Reading saves people. That's so cheesy but it's true. We need stories. Humans need to know that there's more out there than what's immediately right in front of them. It's life, it's living, it's everything we were put on earth to imagine.\n4. Favorite singer is @joey_wingster (https://twitter.com/joey_wingster).

I took a chance in my Gothic Lit class and wrote my final research paper on that section arguing that they were gay, basically, and I ended up winning a $3000 scholarship. It felt so unreal. So yes I love Dracula. I know it's kinda heavy in terms of prose and some shit just doesn't make any sense, but if you don't take it too seriously and just read the plot you'll realize it's HILARIOUS. People tend to approach Dracula through such a very solemn, very serious lens but PLEASE DON'T! Everybody in the main cast -- especially Van Helsing -- is literally snorting so much cocaine the entire plot. There're so many parts where Dracula just ??? Becomes kind of lizard-y and scales his castle walls for no reason? Lucy Westerna has no thoughts head empty just vampire neck sucky sucky all the time. I won't reveal any spoilers but the novel is *hilarious* as it is brilliant. Don't get turned off by the mid-Victorian prose and fancy words (he uses 'voluptuous' A LOT we get it Bram you're horny).

According to Goodreads, she's my most-read author, but that's only because her mystery novels are so easy to read and I can't get enough of them. She's brilliant. She's the best. If anyone wanted to get into the Golden Age of the detective fiction genre, Agatha's the one you should look at. The first book I ever read of hers in high school -- The ABC murders -- genuinely got me hooked. If you need recommendations I suggest starting with The Murder on the Orient Express, And Then There Were None, or The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. Ah! I love her. Obviously keep in mind that she was writing in the early 20th century and thus you inevitably have to come into contact with problematic concepts and other things in her pieces, but she's worth it. She's clever and funny and witty and I adore her.\n\nI could go on and on about Agatha but this is already getting quite long. Feel free to ask me anything, by the way. I promise you even if I don't understand it immediately I'll do my best to translate your message to English for myself to respond to.

I don't have a big piece of official paper saying 'EU IS A LITERARY PRODIGY' signed by Oprah or anything, but in every English class I've taken I've received above-average grades. (Please remember that even getting one grade over 85% in a Humanities course is extremely rare and most of my professors had only seen 2-3 students manage it in their decades of teaching).\n\nAs for my stats (lol), I currently have a 4.0 GPA, an average of 90 or above in all my classes, and am -- as far as I know -- the only one in my graduating year (this spring 2022) who's applying for an MA program immediately after I finish my undergrad. I've also been declared a child prodigy by the University of the Philippines after a series of tests, but that's just in general. Not exactly related to literary studies. The thing is, for eighteen years, I was never allowed to focus on literature completely. I was supposed to be a doctor, lawyer, or something else in STEM. I knew I had high proficiency in reading and writing, I've won a few awards, and I'd been published in magazines. But I genuinely didn't know those things were 'outstanding' or 'exceptional' until I took IB English in high school. I suppose you could say I'm a late bloomer. I was completely in the dark and didn't know I saw stories differently from everyone else. I'd been good at normal English classes up until Grade 11, but I thought it was whatever. It was also a complete accident that I took IB English to begin with. I didn't think I was good enough. But one day I remember being in a discussion with my class and nobody knew the answer to a teacher's question, so I leaned in and said my opinion, and the teacher looked so impressed that I immediately became his favorite. That made me realize, \"Oh hey I guess literature doesn't come naturally to most people.\" I guess I was scouted. It was all downhill from there. \n\nI hope this answered your question. Only a handful of people outside of my university's English Department would call me a literary prodigy though. My parents deny it, as do a lot of my friends who think all I do is read all day. I hope people understand that when I say I'm good at what I do, it's not out of arrogance or thinking I'm better/smarter than anyone else. Quite the opposite, really. It's just what feels right.

I'm currently a high school student, and I'm in France, so the system is a little bit different from yours I believe. I have chosen a few majors, which are literature, english and economics & sociology. I have to make a choice by the end of the year to give up one of them. And I've been wondering, since I know you're a in a literature major, what do you intend to do after that ? I'm really passionate of literature and the more I think of it, the more I believe it's the one thing that won't bore me at some point. However I decided to go into sociology because my dad is kind of a dick and wanted me to go into sciences but I suck at it so that was a compromise. He thinks I won't be able to get a job - let alone a good one.\nAnd I thought I could bare with sociology but I have to go through the economics classes and I honestly can't stand it. \nI might be able to go against his opinion and wishes - but I need to know where I go myself. So I wondered if you knew which kind of outcome there is ? I'm really passionate in seeing the differences in literature in different languages and culture. I thought maybe being a uni teacher would suit me, tho the exams are very selective so I kinda need a second arrow to my bow, you know hehe.\nAnyways I think I'm done ! Sorry for the big text and I hope this question doesn't bother you - I didn't really know to who I could've adressed it. It's fine if you don't wish to respond or just don't know krkrkr\nBy the way I really really love your different analysis, I think I've almost read them all, I'm obsessed with it, it's so interesting ! I haven't found the time yet but hey, I'm really looking forward to reading your fics too ! 😋","reply":"That's a lot of majors! :0 You're right in that I don't know how France's university/education system works but here in Canada the most majors you can take is two. You've got a fun -- but also exhausting -- mix of subjects. I'd give up more than just one, but you're probably tougher than me.\n\nI don't have any immediate plans for a career after I finish my undergraduate because I'm going to graduate school still, but oh the classic \"a Humanities will never get you a good job\" excuse. Ha. English majors are actually some of the most qualified people for jobs. Yknow a lot of us end up as politicians? Magazine editors? Scriptwriters for blockbuster movies? Even doctors! Lawyers! Architects! It is a gateway degree. Studying literature isn't just reading books. The bulk of it is learning how to analyze things critically (which is very hard and will easily be the best thing you learn in your life) and learning how to write. Yknow how many jobs require stuff like looking over data? Researching? Writing reports? Writing theses? Essays? Political speeches and proposals? Try pretty much any job. Arguably more than some STEM-related jobs. (STEM majors get rejected from SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES because they can't write. It's tragic!). \n\nYou're in high school though. You have a lot of time to figure it all out. Do what makes you happy. Who cares about a job or parental approval or even what regular society calls a stable career? At the end of the day you're going to have to live with yourself -- not your bosses, not your parents, or the people who may judge you. And you deserve to choose the path that makes you most happy. You're capable of more things than you think you are. Things will work out if you pursue what you want to pursue. I say go for it.\n\nAlso don't worry you're not at all bothering me. I absolutely know what it's like to be where you are rn and I cannot count all the times I wished I had somebody to answer my questions. I'm happy to listen to you and I don't mind the long cc at all!

Don't take him that seriously. Especially his Tragedies. (If anything, take his Comedies more seriously). Hamlet still manages to make me laugh even though I've read it hundreds of times. Shakespeare was a person -- a very horny bisexual brilliant person. Don't think of him as this dreary, bygone Father of Literature and instead see him as your old buddy who understands you to your deepest core it's just he talks a little funny\n2. Get copies of Shakespeare *with annotations*. Never read them as is. Some plays are easy to understand but none of them make total sense *unless* you have annotations or you're Elizabethan/Tudor royalty\n3. Read it out loud! Whenever I read Shakespeare I just hole myself up in my room and recite it. I promise you it slaps so much harder when you pretend to be onstage soliloquizing via these characters who can describe heartache like there's no fucking tomorrow (*cough* Juliet). Be as dramatic as you want, too!\n4. Watch the performances! (Or look up audio performances online). Nothing beats the visual experience. I highly recommend watching the plays being performed on stage instead of in movies/TV shows. Not to say they're necessarily bad but Shakespeare wrote *for* performance's sake. You could find a bunch of (free) productions online. Shakespeare's timeless; humans never stop re-enacting him. There're a lot of cool productions that have anachronistic, intersectional, and contemporary elements now! I've seen a version of Romeo and Juliet with a biracial couple! I saw Othello played by a black trans woman. I've seen people play around with the special effects of The Tempest really well. My favorite modern-day rendition is Digital Theatre's Much Ado About Nothing (2013) with Catherine Tate as Beatrice and David Tennant as Benedick. I highly suggest watching a live play (if you can); people get so creative with it and there's genuinely nothing like watching the drama of it all unfold in front of you. It's what William would've wanted. The crazier, the funnier, the better: He would've been so proud. (Also it depends on you if you want to watch the play before you read the actual text or vice versa; I prefer to read it first so I can get a general summary of what's happening but the first read-through is always like getting handed the skeleton -- the flesh and organs and great smushy red stuff comes with the live performance.\n5. If you want a good introduction to Shakespeare, his Comedies/Romances are your best bet. Pick the popular ones like A Midsummer Night's Dream, Twelfth Night, or As You Like It. (My favorite one's Measure for Measure it's SO underrated). Read his Tragedies later (start with Macbeth or Hamlet) and THEN his Histories.\n5. Genuinely cannot emphasize enough how there are more sex jokes than most people can count. If he's leading up to a joke, the punchline is probably \"penis.\"","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1244786368,"likes":0,"timestamp":1634058390,"seconds_elapsed":93517735,"comment":"I feel like this is you https://twitter.com/bsdwhisper/status/1447229287787114497?s=21","reply":"hehe","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1244130615,"likes":0,"timestamp":1633575411,"seconds_elapsed":94000714,"comment":"Uh I really hope this doesn’t sound weird but uh could we be friends?😭 ofc I get if not cus it’s the internet and you don’t know me","reply":"Well we could be!

You’ve mentioned here and there your therapist and I was wondering like, was this your first therapist and you’ve just sticked to them ever since or did u meet different therapists and then stuck to this one? See..my problem is Ik therapy is great for a person, and Ik that in order for it to work u have to be completely honest, but tbh with you ive had a couple of therapists (I’m 18) and I’ve never been able to bring myself be honest with any of them, I just can’t. It’s not that they were bad, I just didn’t “connect” with them in way that made me comfortable enough be honest with them. Honestly I wish i could meet one that wasn’t so much abt professionalism because ig that’s what makes me not want to talk, it feels like I’m talking to a robot in a sense if you get what I’m saying but I also understand they can’t just be buddy buddy with u they’re professionals sooo. Sorry this was so longggg alsooo I hope ur doing well!!❤️😅","reply":"Hi my love! You're not alone at all; I don't know anyone who hit it off perfectly with their first or even second therapist. My therapist now is technically the fifth one I've had since starting therapy in high school. I did not like some of my health professionals; in fact, I don't like my current psychiatrist right now. I find her quite mean. Therapy is great but, like with most things that are worth it, it's trial and error and you will most probably have to navigate through a complex array of health professionals until you land the right one for you. It's like dating! But for your depression! \n\nI totally relate to you not feeling like you can be completely honest to your therapist. I'm a naturally closed off person as well and don't like opening up -- especially if I don't feel comfortable with my therapist. Connection's really important. You as the patient and your comfort is priority; and every (good) therapist should be respectful and mindful of that. Trust me when I say the therapist is not allowed to be offended if you decide to switch or change therapists. It's part of their job; you're not the first one to do it and you're certainly not the last! It's very, very common. Again: it's like dating. You have to choose what's best for you. However, you have to do some of the work as well. From what you've told me it seems like the majority of the problem is with your robot therapists, but also work on your communication skills! If a therapist's approach to your healthcare isn't working for you, tell them! They would honestly appreciate it since it's THEIR JOB to help you BASED ON YOUR NEEDS. Sometimes I find that at first I don't vibe well with a healthcare professional but then I tell them some relatively 'deep' stuff about me and communicate what works and they accommodate me as best they can. They're human! They're doing a job! Help them help you.\n\nAlso, since you're 18 I'm assuming you're considered an adult in your country, which opens up a lot more opportunities for health for you. When I turned 18 I had better access to counsellors because I was no longer under parental supervision and could make decisions on my own. It sucks (especially since a lot of minors need professional help and should have more of a say in their mental healthcare than what they're allowed). So definitely look into that. \n\nNo worries about this cc being long. I like long ccs and my response was hella long too haha.

Do you have any tips for writing a good report?","reply":"I don't know the parameters of your assignment so please accept/reject my thoughts as you see fit since you know your project best.\n\nThe best advice I ever got about report-writing about articles is that you're basically telling your teacher/advisor/etc. *your* opinion on the article. Basically imagine that you're talking to a friend (or an acquaintance who requires you speak with academic professionalism, if that helps you better), and see the report as like a long-winded dialogue/conversation you're having with your reader. Depending on how long your report has to be, pick out the main ideas from the article (usually the good standard is 3-4 points) and those will become your main arguments and paragraphs.\n\nAlso, before you submit it, read it out loud! If it sounds awkward vocally, you should probably look at the sentence again. This technique's helped me pick out a lot of run-on sentences in my papers!\n\nAnd lastly, tell yourself that you've got this. I'm assuming from this cc that you might not have as much experience writing reports on articles, but keep reminding yourself that that's alright and you are a living, learning organism that improves with time and practice! The report is not the end of the world. You can absolutely kick its ass and write it extremely well. I believe in you, so reciprocate!

I read both of these books in practically one sitting; I devoured the words like chocolate, dear Reader, you don't understand. With Frankenstein, I was so obsessed: the aesthetic, the Romanticism, the way that it *invented* modern scifi, the religious imagery, the Creature as a character -- oh God, the *prose* ??? oh fuck \"Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.” MARY HAD NO BUSINESS WRITING THIS *PRISTINELY* LIKE HOLY SHIT I AM LITERALLY ONLY CAPABLE OF CERTAIN SOUNDS BECAUSE OF THIS BOOK!!!\n\nAnd I just like No Longer Human cause it's sad.

(If you can), write what you know and infuse little details in your life into the story. That way you won't have to remember them as much. When I wrote my first multi-chapter fic I made some plot points/details reflective of my life like \"Oh I'll just make Chuuya like strawberries because my best friend likes strawberries and I can remember that bc he reminds me of him sometimes\" or \"Dazai has round glasses like me so any time I refer to his face I could mention something about *my* face.\" It's a very handy way to engage in worldbuilding while incorporating the fantasy/escapist elements of fanfiction; it's basically like you're writing fanfiction with the small pieces of your life -- which is what all writing is, I think. \n2. For the stuff that's harder to remember for your story (e.g. dates, numbers, ages, etc.), keep a master document. Or a notebook. Or anything that works for you. Something that's easy to reference when you're in the middle of writing and you have to mention how Character A has to do homework but you forgot what you made their college major 5 chapters ago so you can check your master document fairly easily without having to pour over the last 5 chapters. Keeping the master document around is also great for brain dumping and outlines. Go crazy. Use arrows. Scribble like the eccentric artist you are. This is also helpful for breaking your story into manageable (and less scary) chunks. Sometimes it's useful to separate them by scene or by word count (I advise not using word count as a measure of success though; it tends to be disheartening even if you did good work that day because you didn't reach your desired word count). My outlines are usually like CHAPTER 1 --> Part 1 --> Scene 1(like I'm fucking Shakespeare or something) and it gets more and more detailed from there in the bullet points. \n3. Be kind to yourself. Writing a multi-chapter fic is daunting but it shouldn't make you miserable. It should be fun! Fanfiction's supposed to be fun! Genuinely make the experience as enjoyable for you as possible. You *will* run into issues, editing is a bitch, and mistakes will be made, but that's okay because you still win in the end since you had an absolute blast.\n4. Don't write like JK Rowling.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1241365860,"likes":0,"timestamp":1632352201,"seconds_elapsed":95223924,"comment":"What is one ship that you can't stand in BSD?","reply":"Atsushi lost his leg a couple times he probably can’t stand much in BSD","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1241036141,"likes":0,"timestamp":1632352121,"seconds_elapsed":95224004,"comment":"https://twitter.com/ranpoopie/status/1439201991167729668?s=21 the qrts here are so annoying like just let ppl have their fun ig?? 🙄","reply":"Yeah that’s lame let people enjoy what they want","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1240028799,"likes":0,"timestamp":1631861884,"seconds_elapsed":95714241,"comment":"please save that scene about dick governess it’s so funny","reply":"I’ve moved it to a scene in CIHY Chapter 20 so we shall see lmao","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1239045870,"likes":0,"timestamp":1631861852,"seconds_elapsed":95714273,"comment":"Hi, I saw your tweet about struggling to write fluff!

BSD’s “villain” doesn’t have to be embodied in a specific character, but I’d say certain characters represent parts of this whole corruption (which is more true to life imo). The series is more lax about who counts as villains and as heroes (and everything in between), but the story has a very, very obvious stance in terms of sociopolitics, the messy, messy justice system, and the state in which global affairs are carried out. If I had to name a specific “baddie,” it’d be the negligent + incompetent military police, the government, and the ones behind the curtain who treat lives so monstrously that they, as well as the corrupt systems that govern the world, produce nothing but monsters forced to wander like stray dogs in this unforgiving, cruel world","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1233412179,"likes":0,"timestamp":1629231711,"seconds_elapsed":98344414,"comment":"hey! its a little bit random but seeing ur amazing taste in literature, i was wondering if u have any fav skk fanfics? hope you have a nice day :)","reply":"I answered a question like this a long time ago (you can read my response here: https://curiouscat.qa/eu_gi_oh/post/1188185289), and my answer is still embarrassingly the same 😖 I am so bad when reading BSD fan created content 🤡 (And when I do read it I just read pain, not fluffy feel-good fics).

That’s really cool that you’re in Biochem! I actually considered pursuing Biochem before I transfered to Literature so hehe nice choice if I do say so myself 😌 I hope you’re enjoying it!\n\nThey’re extremely interchangeable and bleed through the other. The basic difference between a metaphor and symbolism is that a metaphor is a comparison of one unlike thing to another unlike thing) i.e. The water was glass; The water is literally not glass, but its mirroring and reflective appearance evokes the image of the material glass, so the narrative makes the comparison through metaphor).\n\nA metaphor can (and often does) carry symbolism in it (i.e. The water was glass is already a metaphor, but the metaphor can be taken a step further if the author is clever enough so that it could also symbolize something else entirely for the sake of making their point; like making the material of glass symbolize purity, therefore comparing the literal water to glass makes the reader imagine its glassy appearance by likening it to glass, while also at the same time they associate such glassiness with virtue and honor. It’s just layers and layers of meaning stacked on top of each other). Symbolism is the use of an actual symbol (usually a reoccurring or heavily emphasized one within the text, like for example Gatsby’s green light or Macbeth’s bloody dagger) to represent a tangible concept (usually a narrative theme, like the effects of usurpation + guilt or the idealistic—yet unattainable—illusion of the American Dream).\n\nLike I said they’re very interchangeable. I’m sure a quick Google search could explain their differences better than I can so I do apologize if I just confused you more. To be honest, I’m so far into my degree that most don’t even really care as much if you switch the two up so I haven’t really had to think much on their difference until now 😅","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1232957078,"likes":0,"timestamp":1629188163,"seconds_elapsed":98387962,"comment":"Hellooo\nSummer is very hot this year\nRemember to stay hydrated","reply":"I am drinking water whilst simultaneously dehydrating myself further by crying over climate change as we speak /j","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1232765282,"likes":0,"timestamp":1629188067,"seconds_elapsed":98388058,"comment":"‪Hey!

I know we don't know each other but I have no doubt you'll do well in September. The nervousness has to happen (and maybe it'll never leave), but that's okay! I get anxious about my degree all the time and I'm almost close to graduating. It's all a part of the experience. Sometimes it can even be exciting.\n\nThere aren't any specific books I'd tell you to read. A lot of people think there's a checklist of must-reads you have to have done before you enter into university to qualify as a proper literature scholar, but that's not true. You read what you want -- whether how little or how much is up to you. There are some texts that you can't avoid with a lit degree obviously -- like Hamlet and The Great Gatsby, which I know everyone in my senior year of hs had to read (most didn't lmao) -- but again, I say just cross that bridge when you get there. There were times when I took a class and the assigned readings were stuff I had already read (i.e. I read Frankenstein by Mary Shelley and Dracula by Bram Stoker the summer before I took my Gothic Lit class in the fall, which required both of them to be read by the end of December), but that was just a nice coincidence and didn't really 'improve' my learning -- if anything, I was at a disadvantage from everyone else who was reading the books for the first time because I had already read them on my own time for leisure without the teachers to guide me. Basically, I understand wanting to get yourself ready for it, but sometimes the best way to approach things is to just wing it and dive in raw. Think about it: You're pursuing a literature degree to learn about literature in the years you'll be in school. Not only do you have plenty of time, but you're also there to *learn* and be *taught* by people you're *paying* to do that. You don't need to arm yourself with further requirements or feel like you're falling behind because you didn't 'prepare' yourself enough. If we wait until we're ready we'll be waiting all our lives. I know that this advice isn't exactly world-changing and probably not what you were looking for, but I wish someone four years ago had told me to just say fuck it and believe in myself more before I started this degree. Nothing goes according to plan, and it's almost always better that way. The best I can really do for you is wish you luck and tell you that, no matter what, you will be amazing, and I'm so excited for you to be starting this academic journey for yourself! That's so lame of me to say but it's so true! The start of a new degree is always extraordinary! I wish I could throw confetti at you, but that might be taking it too far. Anyway, I hope this helped. If not, feel free to ask me general questions or just spam my cc with any other thoughts you have about lit. I'm sure you'll be just fine, but I'm more than happy to give more advice since I'm supposed to be, like, a senior (whatever that means).","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1227282067,"likes":0,"timestamp":1627340457,"seconds_elapsed":100235668,"comment":"Do you think Kunikida was the Azure King? They have the same eye colour, the same hair colour, they should've been around the same age back then, bc Sasaki was Kunikida's age, wasn't she? It says that Kunikida dislikes authority. They even have the same Japanese VA. And their ideals are kinda similar, with one difference: The Azure King killed, Kunikida wants to save. It would also explain his connection to Rokuzo, why he feels so guilty. I don't know, this all just won't leave me alone. And his body was never found, right? So maybe the bomb was just so he could go underground and start a new life. Maybe he realized what he did wasn't the best. Or maybe someone convinced him that there's sth better he could do with his life. And the bombs? I would trust Kunikida with either making them with his notebook or actually building them himself. But at the same time, Sasaki would've recognized him I guess... But maybe she did. And she just didn't say it, for his sake. Or maybe she already knew that Kunikida was a member of the ADA, that's why she targeted them in the first place.

(kinda) you can read it here: https://twitter.com/eu_gi_oh/status/1391131592756629508?s=20. \n\nNo, I do not think Kunikida was literally the Azure King; both the physical and personal similarities they have are clearly supposed to align them as parallel foils. It's an interesting theory to think Kunikida's living a double life and everything, and I am not AT ALL here to tell you to not believe in it if you genuinely find it plausible and interesting because there are NO right answers. That being said, personally, I don't think it fits well with the themes of BSD and Light Novel 1 -- or Kunikida's character arc in general if he and the Azure King were the same person. I think it's far more interesting to consider them as separate beings who diverge from the same origins because the reason why the two mirror each other so well is because the Azure King's extremism is meant to reflect back on the pitfalls of Kunikida's idealism, which Dazai points out and challenges a lot in LN 1. I talk a lot about this and more in my analysis that I linked up there ^^ ; no pressure to read it at all obviously but I am definitely like you in that I've given this a lot of thought and that it won't leave me alone. Even though it was hardly touched on in the anime the Azure Messenger storyline was fascinating to me and I 100% relate to you wanting to hear others' opinions on it. Again: you should decide for yourself what you think -- don't stop believing in something just because my opinion's just a bit different!!

So, do you think there's a connection between the way the old boss of the PM slicked back his hair and the way Mori does when he acts as the boss? We see him slicking it back after playing the innocent civilian in the Guild arc, so does it have sth to do with the job of the boss? And while we're at it, Gide has a similar hairstyle, same as Fukuchi. And also: Ango. Do you think there are any connections? If yes, which ones? Next would be people who cover one eye with their hair or other means: Dazai in his mafia time (both with his bandages *and* his hair. I never see people mention it, but he actually fully covered his right eye with his hair and covered that hair with bandages again. So he also definitely cut his hair after defecting from the mafia), Chuuya (not all the way, I know, but on one side it almost hangs over his eye), Ace, Kouyou, Gogol, and Natsume. And also kinda Rimbaud and Verlaine. Do you think that has any meaning? Bc if we look at all those characters, they would be considered more in the ''morally black'' area. Besides Natsume I guess, but that's also not really true; we know basically nothing about him after all. Who knows what he's doing in the background or what he did in the past. And do you have any other connections you noticed while watching/reading/thinking about bsd? Thank you!","reply":"I've never really thought about most of these theories but the connections you've made are pretty interesting, especially how you brought up when Mori had his hair down during the 'innocent civilian' act and then slicked it back when it was revealed to be the PM Boss. I don't really know how it connects to the others as much, but I guess the slicked back look is such a traditionally formal, professional hairstyle that dates back to the days when the original authors were alive, so I guess they're just tell-tale signs of these characters being Important and Part Of Something Big. That's really cool though I hadn't thought of relating Mori with the old boss through hairstyles haha.\n\nDazai's bandages + hair over his right eye from Dark Era are symbolic. It's his \"blind\" spot and you can notice on official arts/general content that Chuuya's the one guarding that side of his profile to show the deep-seated trust between them. It also represents how Dazai's worldview up until he defects from the mafia bc of Oda has been so darkened and inhibited, and, when he starts to see with both eyes post-Dark Era, things become more clear to him. In the BEAST AU the position of the bandages + hair over his eye is switched to his left, which has its own symbolism ofc. (Good catch on that side of his hair being longer so that it covers the bandaged eye as well, I definitely agree that he had a haircut after quitting). As for the other characters you mention that sort of do the same thing like Ace, Kouyou, Gogol, Natsume, etc. (I don't think Chuuya necessarily fits this, but it's completely up for interpretation), then I'd say the same sentiment applies to them (so yes I agree with your 'morally gray/black' comment). We don't know much about Ace, Gogol, Natsume (as you mentioned), Rimbaud, and Verlaine, but Kouyou fits that pattern of engulfing/limiting her perspective within the darkness and the darkness alone that Dazai used to do; I think when we see flashbacks of young Kouyou her bangs don't cover her eye yet, but I'm not sure. \n\nThese were really fun to just brainstorm some ideas on !! I have made a bunch of other connections while looking through BSD on my own but this answer is getting too long and I feel like I've already mentioned them on my main account way too often. Thank you very much for this ask though. Up until I got this cc most of my 'thoughts' on this stuff was pretty much 'uhh their character design is just cool ig.'","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1228022186,"likes":0,"timestamp":1627338281,"seconds_elapsed":100237844,"comment":"Hellooooo\nI hope you have wonderful day, beautiful!\nTake care","reply":"Thank you very much !!

Dazai whines when he somehow manages to wiggle out of his grasp but usually he’s so tightly wrapped around his boyfriend that even if he does try sleepwalking subconsciously, he can’t, because he’s being held down too much by a beanpole of a literary idiot\n•They’re not big on petnames but they tease each other about being nerds in their own fields. Like [insert 15 minutes of Dazai rambling about Shakespeare here] and Chuuya listens and afterwards he just says “Wow what a nerd”\n•Whenever they go out (book) shopping, Chuuya has to carry everything but that’s okay because he can just watch his boyfriend bumble around and squeal about bargain prices\n•Whenever a sex scene comes up in movies Chuuya blushes and looks away but Dazai fucking presses his face close to the screen bc “Whoa look at her tits !! 😮”\n•Whenever Chuuya has a bad day it makes Dazai anxious bc he’s so used to people taking things out on him but Chuuya knows this and never does that. In fact, he’s extra affectionate when he’s tired or has his mind on something bc Dazai’s his favorite distraction \n•” *asexual confusion* Wait why are you hard ??” “Bitch because I love you tf”\n•Dazai hums while working. Chuuya turns off the music already blasting in his earbuds just to listen sometimes\n•Chuuya enters Robotics competitions with Tachihara, Ryuu, and Atsushi. Dazai comes and cheers for them; they go out for ramen if their team wins or not because life’s too short to not celebrate the little things\n•Chuuya’s impossible to buy gifts for\n•”Bro I’ve been thinking about this all day” “Bro what” “Bro when you cut off your leg where does the pain go” “In your le—😳 oh shit wair it’s gone so—“ “Exactly bro” “Bro” “Bro exactly”\n•Odasaku’s really proud of his patient. In his reports he notes that, although Dazai does still struggle some days (life isn’t perfect), he’s noticeably happier, and a big part of it is thanks to Nakahara\n\n(I really like your hc about Dazai and his long-winded metaphors. Elaborate sex metaphors are a favorite of mine so I 100% accept it haha). Also you’re welcome! I don’t think any of my ccs or responses to CIHY are ever boring so dw about that.

Café hopping around Yokohama\n•Dazai always wanders off and Chuuya always has to go looking for him, but when he does find him eventually Dazai always gives him a “Oh you found me! ☺️☺️“ smile and it makes Chuuya melt every time\n•They read books out loud to each other and fall asleep to the lull of the other’s soothing voice\n•Dazai buys Chuuya oversized T-shirts and then steals them once they start smelling like him. He returns them once the scent’s left\n•”I think it’s fucked up that parrots can speak” “Dazai wtf it’s 5 AM” “I stayed up to finish my Kate Chopin book”\n•Chuuya buys Dazai flowers sometimes. He presses them in between his books\n•Even though they’re dating they’re also both very independent creatures. They can go very long bouts of time without seeing the other (so long as they’re still close by and reachable). Neither of them are exceptionally clingy, and are good at being by themselves. Ofc they prefer to be together but any sort of huge distance wouldn’t affect their relationship negatively like it does with a lot of partners. Since they’re in separate academic fields and probably have different goals in life, they spend a lot of time apart—especially once they graduate. Everyone doubts they’ll make it bc young love doesn’t last, but they do, and they learn to become even more grateful for however much or how little they get to see each other because that makes those times all the more special. \n•They spoil Baki and take him out for a lot of walks\n•Whenever Dazai starts regressing into his Dumb Sad Shit™️ and says stupid stuff like “What if you grow bored and leave me 🥺🥺” Chuuya just says a flat out “No” bc he figures he’ll just show Dazai instead of constantly reassure him that he’ll stay forever. So he does. Obviously.\n•Chuuya and Yumeno play videogames together. Chuuya takes the stuff somewhat competitively but Yumeno’s just there for the fun of it. They become very good but odd friends\n•Whenever Chuuya buys Dazai books he writes inscriptions in them but they’re like “I didn’t read this. Hope you like it though.”\n•They take a lot of naps together. Chuuya gets cold easily and Dazai hates being too hot; it’s a good balance.\n•Lots of kissing, dear Reader. Lots of kissing that it’s almost irredeemably repulsive.\n\nThere’s definitely a lot more obviously, but I don’t want to bore you or make you read such a long answer 😅 I hope these weren’t too cringey.

Or do you maybe have any tips on how to deal with it?","reply":"Whenever I experience sensory overload the urge to scratch at or squeeze something (usually my body, which often results in me hurting myself) in order to ground/distract myself from the overwhelming feelings skyrockets. There’re other things like me being more fidgety, anxious, and irritable, but that’s the biggest one I struggle with. The best solution I’ve had is having my mochis/plushies/soft things to hold as kind of like stress that’re balls always on hand. With the scratching, I am still dealing with it, but what’s helped is me focusing my scratching on something harmless like bedsheets or a piece of clothing that won’t harm my skin; I also got a phone case that’s especially tough and durable and it’s withstood my scratches for a long while now. I’m getting better at scratching at and picking at my skin/scars because of this.\n\nFor general tips, the biggest one is *definitely* to train yourself to realizing your sensory overload *is* sensory overload. Before I knew what it was I just thought there was something fundamentally wrong with me and the frustration of not knowing how to solve how anxious I was, made me more anxious. So learn to point out when you’re experiencing it (it takes practice so be patient with yourself!), because knowing what it is means one step closer to solving it. Once you realize it’s happening you can remind yourself that it’s okay; after this, you usually can also notice other things that might be exacerbating it like you sitting in a bad position or being near something really loud; unclenching your body or changing the way you’re sitting or even loosening your jaw could help a lot when you recognize you unconsciously did it since they’re common reactions to sensory overload. \n\nAfter that, find something that’ll calm you down. This is different for everyone (like for me, it’s the squishable plushies). Breathing exercises (deep breaths in and out) work to slow your heart rate. So does drinking water or getting up to do a quick lap around the room. Stretching helps some people too. Listening to loud music is a popular one as well. If the environment you’re in is stressful and is causing/impacting the sensory overload, do as much as you can to get out of the situation; never feel like you need to apologize for excusing yourself or simply just leaving! If you absolutely cannot make an exit, and all you can do is the stimming/fidgeting + breathing + reassuring yourself + basic exercises, then that is 100% okay. Usually it’s more than enough to just have a way to let it out + regulate it. Allow yourself the little comforts (again, you aren’t being selfish ever if it’s for the sake of you feeling better); and always, always, always keep in mind that this state isn’t permanent and everything will turn out alright soon (which takes a lot of practice to remember, I know, but I believe in you !!).","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1225554896,"likes":0,"timestamp":1626474392,"seconds_elapsed":101101733,"comment":"https://twitter.com/TheAndrewNadeau/status/1415826510225756165?s=20 Hope this will make you smile 💙","reply":"I saw this right before my nap and then immediately passed out peacefully so thank you hehe ☺️","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1224649201,"likes":0,"timestamp":1626195899,"seconds_elapsed":101380226,"comment":"just saw your annotations in your books (which I think it usually takes you a lot of time?

Do you have a goodreads account? If so, when theres a book that’s boring or  you just cant seem or see yourself finishing, do you still rate it? I am recently struggling whether to accept that a book ive decided to just not continue on with, whether it can be something i can “rate” because i still like the idea of looking back on my year and getting an accurate account all of the things i did read ( whether good or bad )","reply":"Yes I have a Goodreads account! Personally, I don’t rate books I don’t finish on there bc whenever I come across a book I can’t deal with I just don’t bother thinking about it after I put it down. But! That being said, I feel like you being unable to finish the book to review *is* a review in and of itself. “I didn’t really like it and I don’t see myself continuing this. ⭐️” *is* a valid way to rate a book. You’re not being unfair by not finishing it. I have read very, very few books that I hated immediately that turned out to be decent when I slogged through them—and usually, if they are, the highest rating I give them is like three stars, which is the Goodreads equivalent of “meh.” Life is too short to not read what you want to read. Never be ashamed for not completing a novel or stopping in the middle of a poem bc you found it boring. Basically: if it isn’t a “good read” for you, then it’s just not; and GoodReads (and the authors) can still learn a lot from that kind of feedback/review. You’re allowed to dislike things and talk honestly about why you don’t. (Obviously don’t be rude to writers but *plenty* of them need to be humbled or given a reality check sometimes; a lot are just one bad review away from realizing their writing sucks and just because they got money from books doesn’t mean those books should’ve been published in the first place 😶😶 If that’s the case, you could be doing a service to the world of literature honestly). \n\n(Also fun fact: Two guys from high school have actually tried to ask me out on Goodreads 💀💀 It’s not THAT big of a deal but bruh why did it happen twice 🙃🙃)","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1224392267,"likes":0,"timestamp":1626194960,"seconds_elapsed":101381165,"comment":"What did you do to me\nBefore: *I watch Les Misérables*\nNow: *I watch Les Misérables* And then there's this reoccurring colour and music theme that stands for XY and comes up whenever YZ happens-","reply":"I have no idea what I did to get you where you are now but clink clink Les Misérables bangs always","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1224324525,"likes":1,"timestamp":1626194755,"seconds_elapsed":101381370,"comment":"Hi, do you have recommendations for annotate books? Do you highlight the text while you read a book the first time or when you reread? In my case, if is a book for homework or in a language I'm studying I like to highlight it (later colour code turns a mess) or write with pencil. But if is a novel by my favourite author or similar, even if I want to analyse it, I'm afraid to do a mess","reply":"(I’m attaching pictures of examples of my annotations, you can see them on Twitter). When I first started annotating books in high school (for fun + for assignments), I was one of those people who had a legend (Picture 1), sticky notes (Picture 3), highlighters, placemarkers (Picture 3), different colored pens, etc., but I’ve long since outgrown that method since it’s really exhausting. (Sometimes I still do it, but never for full-length novels anymore; usually just plays or poetry—See: Picture 4—and even then my ‘legends’ are simple). However, if what you’re doing right now is working for you, I say stick with it! It’s definitely something you gradually figure out for yourself as you go along. Don’t be ashamed of trial and error. If highlighting or just having one pencil handy helps you focus better, then keep it! The most recent books I’ve annotated were just in pencil with occasional notes in the margins/blank pages. It’s really all up to you. Also, don’t stress when you go pages and pages *without* making any life-altering notes or revelations about the text; the point of annotation is for you to organize your thoughts for yourself, *not* to catch every single detail the author puts in it.\n\nI only ever reread “important passages” (you should see my annotations on Hamlet’s “To Be Or Not To Be” speech oh God there’s no room left on that page for even a period mark anymore 🤡) and never complete novels front to back; usually I just read it through first and make my notes as I go. I think the first time you read something cultivates a lot of interesting thoughts and introspections that a second or third read just can’t replicate. That’s not saying to hold your first reading at a superior standard. Quite the opposite actually. I think documenting your initial thoughts + coming back to it is always fun and where the real work usually begins. You always notice newer things, and you can cross out or add thoughts on your second or third once-over. You can build up on old ideas and flesh them out. Even if it’s ‘messy’ or incoherent + doesn’t make sense to anyone but you, it’s still you practicing your critical literary skills!\n\nI understand not wanting to ‘mess up’ a favorite book (especially if they’re expensive or from a beloved author), but nine times out of ten I never regret annotating something I really love or find fascinating. In fact, that last 1/10 is just there bc once I start annotating, it takes a lot in me to stop so I’m just sitting there poring over 5 lines from an Emily Dickinson poem searching up terms on the OED or thinking about bird imagery for like an entire day. It’s a really fun brain activity!

And most of the time it really helps to just cover my eyes with some fabric, and either press my hands on my ears or listen to loud music with headphones. The last time it happened I had to think of Dazai while doing it, and the way he covers his eye in his mafia time.

It’s a really cool interpretation in general and I wouldn’t be surprised if it turned out to be the case. The only ‘explanation’ we have about Dazai’s bandages is from the official guidebook, but there’s no English translation. From my understanding they’re remnants of all his past suicide attempts because his body is always under some sort of repair either because of his own clumsiness or lack of self preservation skills. (They’re also just basic symbolism for his sadness). \n\nThat being said, I don’t doubt that he finds comfort in the bandages—they’ve been with him for so long—so I really like your interpretation and can 100% see it happening ☺️👍🏽 One of my oldest headcanons is Dazai experiences sensory issues as well so yeah I really like this","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1222307461,"likes":0,"timestamp":1625365032,"seconds_elapsed":102211093,"comment":"my apologies, this is so out of blue but what are your opinions on haruki murakami ( if you dont mind sharing ofc)","reply":"No need to apologize 🥺 I love Haruki Murakami !!

As a reference to the rl Dazai having a crush on a short boy he met when he was 15 👀 cause I thought that was a reach but then the whole 'I must love you' scene in Fifteen followed by all of Stormbringer happened and now I just..\nIdk about Chuuya but canon sources really imply Dazai gay for Chuuya","reply":"Oh Dazai and Chuuya are definitely queer coded with each other specifically in mind. I’m biased bc I ship them, but it’s very obvious the people who run BSD *know* they’re the most popular ship in this fandom and exploit it for the sake of the series (see: Fifteen being animated, the lap + introductory scenes in Dead Apple, countless official promotional art, Stormbringer, etc.). Even if Asagiri and Harukawa didn’t plan on Soukoku being a big deal in the original manga, positive fandom + audience response to them have basically made the production of SKK content a must (which is probably why they chose to animate BSD Wan instead of make a Season 4 because Dazai and Chuuya have interactions in the Wan manga; not where we’re at in the manga timeline). \n\nSo, if you’re going by ‘canon’ content yeah you can definitely make that argument that they’re romantically interested in one another (as many shippers do), but it is a bit of a stretch to claim it’s explicitly canon—especially as a reference to IRL Dazai’s adolescent crush with a boy at fifteen (but it isn’t impossible; BSD’s made nicher allusions). Ofc it’s all about interpretation. If you think they’re in love, then they’re in love!\n\nI also want to add that we need to keep in mind that there is rampant homophobia in the anime + manga industry, so Asagiri and Harukawa are very limited as to what they can present as ‘canon’ in relation to any queer content. I think they certainly challenge stigmas in their own way, but I don’t think it’s fair (for anybody) to expect too much (especially by Western standards of what we consider as ‘canonically queer’ or not).","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1221905357,"likes":0,"timestamp":1625301464,"seconds_elapsed":102274661,"comment":"Hi, I read your fic Can I Help You? and its one of my fave college aus! I love the humour and fluff mixed with a depiction of mental health issues that feel realistic rather than glamourised! \nJust wondering though, (this is so random but) given CIHY Dazai’s Taylor Swift playlist, what songs from Folklore/Evermore do you think would be his faves given the references to literature I get the vibes he would geek out over? (this is ofc assuming you've even heard the albums so dw about this if you haven't loool)","reply":"It IS a really random question but I highkey love it bc I have actually given this some thought. So for context, there’s HUGE animosity against Taylor Swift in plenty of academic literary circles (which I know aaaaall, aaaaaall … too well) bc her fans compare her to famous writers like Shakespeare, which pisses off a looooooooot of English majors lmfao. So I think CIHY Dazai would be sorra like this crowd and pretend he’s “too good” for TS + roll his eyes at her “attempts at literary critical thinking,” but is also at the same time a Swiftie against his will. Because of that, I don’t think he’d like the songs from folklore/evermore with specific literary references bc he’d probably find them “basic.” I think his favorites from those two albums (in order) would be “the 1,” “exile,” “champagne problems,” “evermore (without bon iver 💀),” and “illicit affairs” since those songs are generally void of lit allusions so he can just bask in the heartbreak vibes.\n\nThank you for this fun question and thank you for reading CIHY !

Yes absolutely she’s worth it!! \n\nI think you should maybe buy just one of her books first—my favorite’s Emma if you want a recommendation 👀—or maybe just read a few beginning lines of one of her novels online. You can quickly find excerpts if you just type in “Sense and Sensibility Chapter 1” or something on your search bar since she’s a late 18th century writer. Her prose tends to get confusing for first-time readers and SO MANY people get turned off from her bc of that. You can still relatively follow along but Pride and Prejudice is much easier to read once you give yourself context/practice. So yes I would say buy all copies but BUY ONLY ONE FIRST just to test the waters. (And make your decision from there). Having a cheap pack and one extra copy of one of the books isn’t too bad—worse is having a pack and not wanting to even touch it after you read through one book!

Your work should open in a way that makes you invested in your project. That could mean just about anything—it could mean opening with something practical like “My birthday was in April. (And then the murders happened)”; or it can be something long-winded that sets the tone of your story like “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. (And then the murders happened).” It really all depends on you, so long as the opening keeps *you* writing. \n\nAlso I think people put too much pressure on openings anyway. I’ve written things that I started writing from the middle and worked myself backwards, forwards, in parts, etc. You never get a second chance to make a first impression, so I don’t see any harm in delaying figuring that bit out for later and getting to the good stuff now.\n\n(And then the murders happened 😉).

I am not exaggerating when I say conference rooms, auditoriums, and lecture halls have been filled to the brim answering this very question -- and, like with everything (intellectual) worth talking about, there's no consensus. I'd be more surprised if you weren't having struggles with this. I still do, and so does everyone in my English department -- from my profs to the students.\n\nThe quickest way to tackle it is to read Roland Barthes' essay \"The Death of the Author\" (here's a pdf copy: https://writing.upenn.edu/~taransky/Barthes.pdf), but it's a confusing read and I can basically just tell you that, according to Barthes, the 'death of the author' is the 'birth of the reader' because the author is not the authoritative figure of any text (whether they've written it themselves or not) and that the meaning of the text does not reside in the author's intent but in the reader's own individual interpretation. The author doesn't have sovereignty over their created work -- the work belongs to the reader. It gives power back to the audience. Knocks the author down a peg. Arguments on the implications of intellectual property aside, I think \"The Death of the Author\" and the way Barthes sees it is a good way to approach literary text (or any body of work, really). I definitely think you should keep the author's intent in mind and background, but don't hold it to the gospel standard like we're taught to do in English classes when you point out how dumb Shakespeare's logic tends to be sometimes your teacher whacks you on the head. \n\nAuthors are human. And humans can be very stupid, biased, and straight-up wrong. (Seriously, if you read a book and just assumed the author is right all the time, you would not have a fun time reading anything). It's a treacherous thing to think a person is more than a person. Yes, Shakespeare's a genius, but he was also an idiot. Such is the nature of man. He definitely didn't intend for *everything* we often pick out from his plays and cite as brilliant. In fact, if Shakespeare knew we regarded his texts today as 'high literature' and took it very, very seriously he'd probably laugh his ass off. \n\nSo my answer to your question is yes and no (frustratingly). I do tend to separate the author from the work, but I'm also not so foolish as to think the author's intent and background doesn't impact the work itself significantly. Osamu Dazai was suicidal, so No Longer Human's about suicide and mental illness. J.K. Rowling's a transphobic racist, so the canon Harry Potter series is trash and what fandom/fans have done with the original storyline is infinitely better than what the original author came up with 🙂🙂 It's okay to struggle with it. We're built to want absolutes. But just know your struggling's not in vain, and you are not alone, and it is much, much more fun this way.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1218014837,"likes":0,"timestamp":1623813451,"seconds_elapsed":103762674,"comment":"what game are yall playing?? im just new to bsd sorry ><","reply":"Welcome to BSD !!

Or am I crazy and just making a mountain out of a molehill?","reply":"You're not making a mountain out of a molehill. It's human to be anxious about not knowing everything -- especially when you desperately want to understand, but can't. You know you can't, and that's agonizingly frustrating. You have to do it every day in this life -- accept that you don't know anything -- but it's maddening. I think everybody struggles with this in one form or another. We tend to think that knowing everything grants us a complete understanding of the said thing, but the more and more you interact with the world the more you realize that isn't the case. I think the best way to explain it is through the Rashōmon Effect; TEDEd actually made a recent video about it that I highly recommend watching: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg5y6Ao7VE4. \n\nIt's definitely something you work on your entire life. Believe me when I say I get anxious when I don't completely grasp what an author's trying to convey on paper -- your example of translations is a big one for me actually, so you're definitely not alone in that. It demotivates me sometimes too. Sometimes I do think I'm crazy for wanting to know everything. But I think that irrational inability to understand everything is important in and of itself; it drives you to learn as much as you can while at the same time reminding you that it's logically impossible. You step closer and closer to the truth, but you never reach it, because the truth isn't a destination, it's the journey you take to reach it. \n\nIf you know everything, what's there left to know? Would it even make you happy? What if 'everything' keeps changing, like truth, over time? What if all the answers are already inside you and you don't exactly have to put them into words or to fully comprehend them for them to be real? If you got everything that a translator was trying to convey, what's the point of them having their job if just about anybody can figure it out with just one look? How would people find their way back to texts? Isn't the very purpose of stories to make you ponder over this vast multitude we call the universe? What is knowing to not knowing? \n\nIt's impossible to know another human being's deepest emotions and thoughts; we can only know ours and how we feel about certain things -- but in what way is that any less? How is our individual interpretation -- small, tiny, and fragile as it is -- any different than the writer who looked at that blank sheet of paper and decided to fill it with their own ideas and words? Ambiguity's the most terrifying thing we encounter, but it's also very reassuring once you remember nobody else knows everything; and there's beauty in the unknown.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1217920735,"likes":0,"timestamp":1623811217,"seconds_elapsed":103764908,"comment":"Hey, you!

No harm in doing that at all).\n\nIncredibly sappy answer coming up, but the most beautiful libraries have a person's beloved stories in them, and once you love a story you don't care anymore for the binding it comes in or the number of pages it takes up. Believe me, I *LOVE* a gorgeous cover like everyone else -- they're just so pretty to look at 🥺🥺 -- but sometimes I read a book for its glamorous cover but then end up liking the cover more than the story. Or then I read a book with a very uninteresting or bland cover and it ends up being my favorite (and then maybe I buy a nicer copy of it later).\n\nYour favorite books become your favorite books -- and will, later on, make up your pretty library -- because you love them for what they are; you'll see past the cheap covers or crinkly paper or worn-out edges eventually. You don't have to 'overcome' anything or even give up wanting beautiful editions -- you already have the love in you, just give the stories a chance.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1217447125,"likes":0,"timestamp":1623809483,"seconds_elapsed":103766642,"comment":"Eu!!!!\nPlease let me share my excitement because I follow your advice (I think I read it in one of your answers) and I search for a second-hand bookstore in my town and i turns out there are two!!

Your claim \"eBooks tend to be offered for free across the internet anyway, which means those eBook versions have been allowed direct downloads by the publishers + authors on the basis of library circulation\" is wrong. Not all publishers/sites that sell eBooks allow direct download. In such cases, people forcefully rip the content from such and then start sharing all over the internet. Z-lib for example has changed url and server for the site many times in the past as authorities have found what shady stuff they are doing. Some research papers are and should be free to all (but for some reason many tend to be behind paywall), but books are still something that gotta be paid for or offered through official libraries or other services in each continent/country. Z-lib and pdfdrive totally aren't anything like that, but I can see the appeal of using something like them. But they are taking away the money from the original creators, as they have some very fresh books too beside older ones. \n\nThe copyright laws are slightly different in each country, but a good rule of thumb is that works become free after 70 years since author's death. 70 is quite basic and used in many countries. In Japan it's 70, but before 2019 it used to be 50. That year they decided to follow many Western countries to avoid some problems with the length difference of such law. When it comes translations, that's another thing. If you/someone have translated something by an author who passed away 70 years ago and their works are now free, but the translator is still alive or hasn't been dead for 70 years, the translated work is still under copyright law. Translations are protected as much as possible, however the moment there is a new one, the older ones might get treated like trash and be thrown to the \"public arena\". Even though they are still under the protection.\n\nWith the internet culture blooming, many live with the thought that things are free on the internet, when in fact they aren't. Someone is working hard for the content and wants their money so they can live and create more. It's not only books we are talking about, but also manga and anime for example. There might be an official app for Shounen Jump where they publish some of their manga that people can read for free, but in fact someone is paying for that so it's possible. There's no way they could offer something that they gotta also pay for to the authors of the mangas. Like all official publishers/services that offer content in legal ways, iIllegal anime/manga sites also gotta pay for the server costs, so they have ads and stuff to make money (which obviously tend to end up them making extra money which goes straight to the pockets of the people who host such sites). Which is why Japan has been really on the edge past few years and taking down illegal sites and hunting down people who don't follow the laws.","reply":"Oh thank you for telling me this information. Like I said, I'm not an expert, so this clarification is much appreciated.\n\nI agree that many feel entitled to free content on the internet because of the rise of digital accessibility and consumerism. I also agree that creators should be paid/compensated for the hard work they do -- not just because of financial stability, but it's basic human decency to reward them for their hard work, and it's a good motivator to cultivate more artwork. I encourage everyone I encounter to check out pdfdrive.com and z-lib.org mainly because most of them who come to me don't have the means to buy books or get through that annoying paywall. In discussions like these -- the ethics of piracy, whether or not downloading content is illegal, etc. -- I find that too much blame is focused on changing the (often financial) situations of the powerless, rather than the powerful. Yes, plenty of authors, translators, artists, etc. do rely on their work's payout for survival, but I believe social programs and the bigtime corporate companies that claim to represent them + promote their work should take the burnt of supporting the arts. If you invest in publication and mass production rights, you should also invest in the person creating it; they are, after all, helping you make a profit for which you would not be able to acquire without their essential work. It's entirely unfair that 'losses' from any sites like pdfdrive.com and z-lib.org should fall entirely on artists while the big companies offset it all through tax evasion -- like I said before, that's blaming individual people instead of the ones who should consider the welfare of their supposed employees more carefully. It is easy to blame a petty thief for taking one's food, but perhaps it is wiser to sometimes question why food must be stolen in the first place? And why, when one's food is stolen, the blame is automatically pinned on the hungry, rather than the ones letting hunger rampage for the sake of profiteering and gatekeeping what should be a human right. \n\nMy metaphor's silly, I know, but I do believe knowledge and information should be accessible and free. Obviously, if you have the ability to pay (and your money goes to a good cause that needs the support, like small businesses or tiny markets), do so, but if a translator's wages significantly decrease just because somebody from a different country wanted to read their work in an accessible language, it'd be ridiculous for their publisher and bosses to simply shrug and say, \"Hey, I can't do anything. You get what we give you.\" Surely there should be more compensation, consideration, and thought given to creators in the business? For their entire revenue to be solely dependent on sales suggests the public has to ensure they do not go hungry -- while the rich keep continuing to gorge themselves on *their* work solely because they 'bought' it.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1217232933,"likes":0,"timestamp":1623542896,"seconds_elapsed":104033229,"comment":"Another anon here\nI just checked those pages you share and they have almost every book I searched, I'm so impressed\n\nI don't want to sound rude, I'm genuinely curious, but do you know if those sites are... legal?

I never really considered it before so I did some digging and refreshed myself on copyright laws. I'm not an expert, but it all depends on your country's law, but honestly, I wouldn't worry about it. (If you're absolutely worried about the legalities of it, you should download a VPN just to keep yourself safe, but it's not necessary). Even if you make the argument that those pages are pirating sites, law enforcement cares more about controlling the suppliers, not the consumers. Also, eBooks tend to be offered for free across the internet anyway, which means those eBook versions have been allowed direct downloads by the publishers + authors on the basis of library circulation. So it isn't illegal, it's like borrowing a book but you get a copy of it if you download it.\n\nAs someone whose been using these sites for a while, I definitely wish more people knew about them. I try to share them without whoever I can. It's definitely saved me a lot of time, money, and energy -- especially in terms of getting university textbooks (I've probably saved over $600 bc of these sites). I'm not a well-off person, so libraries (online or otherwise) are a godsend. Most people can't afford to buy everything they want or need to access. Information and knowledge should be free and easy to acquire no matter what background you're coming from. The copyright law is there to protect original created works' intellectual property rights while at the same time appealing to the public interest for intellectual-related services. You're not taking *any* money away from the original author/creator by using these sites. That line of thinking blames innocent individuals instead of the mass market publishing and education industries that fail to pay researchers, writers, and content creators well in the first place. Take it from someone who's an editor for an academic journal, several magazines, and university newspapers: the publishing industry *sucks* and if you can grab at what you can, you should do it. Yes, it's hard getting properly paid for the stuff you try to get published, but that isn't your readers' fault.

This type of scenario is basically Dazai coming face to face with the darkness he keeps bottled up inside, so if somebody lets theirs go and starts spilling it on the floor he’ll know how to ‘clean it up,’ but to do it well also requires him coming to terms with his own suicidal ideations, which he’s grown so numb to that all he could probably offer is distant advice and reassurance. Yes, he’ll try to help but it forces him to take one step back emotionally for the sake protective numbness/indifference.

Have you done it before, and if yes, why?","reply":"(I had to look up what this meant so I’m sorry if I misinterpreted it; I was definitely told what it was before but I’ve forgotten)\n\nI think it’s fine; we place too much authority on an original author and I believe a body of work can exist on its own without the need for its primary creator. I’ve never read an ‘orphaned’ fic, but I have read books that had ‘ghost writers’ or were written by other people once the original author either gave up on it, passed on the publication rights to someone else, or just straight up died. They’re very interesting; it’s kind of fun to try and see which parts are written by different people.\n\nThat being said, I think to do it successfully and well is very hard. Everyone’s writing style is unique and it’d be hard to imitate it—but then again that’s placing way more credit on the author again. \n\nI’ve never done it and don’t really plan to though. I know you asked about fanfiction, but I feel like if I ever publish anything professionally in general and make a name for myself in the writing arena, any unfinished or incomplete works I end up leaving behind at the end of my ‘career’ can be best left on their own. I’d still like them to be mine though, so no, I wouldn’t ‘orphan’ them in the way that I’d rescind any connection with them.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1216274536,"likes":0,"timestamp":1623293777,"seconds_elapsed":104282349,"comment":"barring the classics, what books would you say  make it to your top 5 (doesn’t have to be just five, go crazy ✨) ? ♥️","reply":"If I went crazy I’d be here all day so:\n1.

Do you keep track if you read all of the works of your favorites authors? for example, I know you love Agatha, do you know if you have read all of her? or just like, search for a story and then you hear about another and jump to it? or do you trust those big books that say 'complete collection of xxxx'? \nI don't know :( maybe I'm freaking out over nothing ldknjvwloeikjdslf T.T","reply":"UM OFC I'VE READ EDGAR I LOVE THAT SPOOKY LITTLE BITCH. You're not crazy for wanting a list, I totally get it. (You're not freaking out over nothing either dw). 'Complete Collection of xxxx' books are really tricky because whoever compiled those works most likely had sales in mind, rather than making an actually exhaustive collection. I tend to avoid those kinds of books since they're usually always missing one or two stories, but they're still really useful for when you want to get started on reading a new author! The editor will always have picked their most popular ones, so it's a good introduction.\n\nAnyway, just from a quick Google search, the Richmond Poe Museum has a timeline of 'all' his works (which you can find here: https://www.poemuseum.org/poes-works-and-timeline), but I think the Wikipedia page on his bibliography does just fine on listing everything he's done (you can find it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe_bibliography). If you're interested, I also made a Twitter recommendation thread a while ago of some of my favorite stories from Edgar if you want to check it out: https://twitter.com/eu_gi_oh/status/1314360663490269184?s=21.\n\nAs for Agatha, I'd recommend using the Wikipedia bibliography page as well (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie_bibliography). It's the page I use to generally keep track of which books I've read of hers, but I have my own tracker in one of my bullet journals bc I don't really want to read *all* of Agatha Christie's works since also she wrote love stories under an alias, not just murder mysteries.\n\nI actually don't really keep track of all the works I've read from my favorite authors. Usually, they only have a handful that I can keep track of it all in my head. Agatha's obviously an exception because she has so many books! I haven't read every book of hers, but I've been slowly making a dent in my collection. I have all of her mystery novels (and plays) that I read in chronological order (from the date they were published), so I'll get to the last one eventually (hopefully not soon though). \n\nI hope this helped! Really happy to hear you're reading Edgar (and maybe Agatha), they're genuinely some of my favorite writers from Western literature and I hope you enjoy them! 🥰🥺💙","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1216201547,"likes":0,"timestamp":1623129394,"seconds_elapsed":104446732,"comment":"idk what to say just wanted to call you cute i guess.","reply":"So true bestie 🥰🥰","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1216200072,"likes":1,"timestamp":1623129381,"seconds_elapsed":104446745,"comment":"See?

Do you keep track if you read all of the works of your favorites authors? for example, I know you love Agatha, do you know if you have read all of her? or just like, search for a story and then you hear about another and jump to it? or do you trust those big books that say 'complete collection of xxxx'? \nI don't know :( maybe I'm freaking out over nothing ldknjvwloeikjdslf T.T","reply":"UM OFC I'VE READ EDGAR I LOVE THAT SPOOKY LITTLE BITCH. You're not crazy for wanting a list, I totally get it. (You're not freaking out over nothing either dw). 'Complete Collection of xxxx' books are really tricky because whoever compiled those works most likely had sales in mind, rather than making an actually exhaustive collection. I tend to avoid those kinds of books since they're usually always missing one or two stories, but they're still really useful for when you want to get started on reading a new author! The editor will always have picked their most popular ones, so it's a good introduction.\n\nAnyway, just from a quick Google search, the Richmond Poe Museum has a timeline of 'all' his works (which you can find here: https://www.poemuseum.org/poes-works-and-timeline), but I think the Wikipedia page on his bibliography does just fine on listing everything he's done (you can find it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe_bibliography). If you're interested, I also made a Twitter recommendation thread a while ago of some of my favorite stories from Edgar if you want to check it out: https://twitter.com/eu_gi_oh/status/1314360663490269184?s=21.\n\nAs for Agatha, I'd recommend using the Wikipedia bibliography page as well (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie_bibliography). It's the page I use to generally keep track of which books I've read of hers, but I have my own tracker in one of my bullet journals bc I don't really want to read *all* of Agatha Christie's works since also she wrote love stories under an alias, not just murder mysteries.\n\nI actually don't really keep track of all the works I've read from my favorite authors. Usually, they only have a handful that I can keep track of it all in my head. Agatha's obviously an exception because she has so many books! I haven't read every book of hers, but I've been slowly making a dent in my collection. I have all of her mystery novels (and plays) that I read in chronological order (from the date they were published), so I'll get to the last one eventually (hopefully not soon though). \n\nI hope this helped! Really happy to hear you're reading Edgar (and maybe Agatha), they're genuinely some of my favorite writers from Western literature and I hope you enjoy them! 🥰🥺💙","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1215639016,"likes":1,"timestamp":1623123157,"seconds_elapsed":104452969,"comment":"this first image, is it from a book?

Because I have hundreds of them and they take a lot of space 😭","reply":"It’s totally your choice whether to power up your R and SR cards to R+ and SR+ cards! I power up every card I get just cause it’s a preference but if you only want to focus on powering up your SSRs, that’s also good too. (Some SRs are actually more powerful than SSRs, I find, but yes generally SSRs are more valuable in battle). \n\nAnyway, if that’s the case, then yes the Fountain Pens and Pencils get way too cluttered in your inventory. No, they’re not really used for anything else other than powering up. The best way to get rid of them (without powering up) is to sell your Materials. What I usually do is keep only 5 Pencils of each color (Dark, Light, Crimson, etc.) and 10 Pens of each color just in case I get a good SR or even an R card that’s worth evolving.

I would even say it’s one of the central ways we get quality information without the high monitoring/censorship/alterations/etc. that big newspaper corporations and other media often do.\n\nHowever, if you’re basing someone’s level of empathy and understanding of a situation (in any context) just on their online presence alone, that’s a problem. When your primary concern is “Why haven’t you retweeted/commented/shared/etc. anything about x topic,” it quickly becomes a mechanical checklist of performative activism that hones in on one person’s account meeting a certain (unattainable) standard of action, rather than the actual issue itself. (This is obviously different to accounts and social media sites that are specifically dedicated to activism as a principle. Here I would say the obligation is more prominent to speak up about issues since that’s what you’re here for).\n\nBut, like I said, social media shouldn’t be the only way you find out or educate yourself about anything—especially regarding important matters like this one.

I would even say it’s one of the central ways we get quality information without the high monitoring/censorship/alterations/etc. that big newspaper corporations and other media often do.\n\nHowever, if you’re basing someone’s level of empathy and understanding of a situation (in any context) just on their online presence alone, that’s a problem. When your primary concern is “Why haven’t you retweeted/commented/shared/etc. anything about x topic,” it quickly becomes a mechanical checklist of performative activism that hones in on one person’s account meeting a certain (unattainable) standard of action, rather than the actual issue itself. (This is obviously different to accounts and social media sites that are specifically dedicated to activism as a principle. Here I would say the obligation is more prominent to speak up about issues since that’s what you’re here for).\n\nBut, like I said, social media shouldn’t be the only way you find out or educate yourself about anything—especially regarding important matters like this one.

I would say Chief Taneda, Gide, Mori, and the other powers within Yokohama's Underground/government were the ones who really killed Oda in the end, and I think, as Dazai gets older and knows more about how the world works, he's gradually starting to see that too.

I just looked through my manga and light novel copies and I'd say the translators Kevin Gifford and Matt Rutsohn are credible since they actually do this for a living, and these aren't the first works they've translated into English. So if you have a copy that has Gifford and/or Rutsohn as the translator, I'd say you're okay. They're the official English translators that I'm assuming the Yen Press' translation department chose, so it's what's technically 'canon,' but ofc that's debatable since I'm sure Gifford and Rutsohn aren't The Number 1 Japanese To English Translators Ever.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1209697638,"likes":0,"timestamp":1620935103,"seconds_elapsed":106641023,"comment":"Hi eu!

I would've loved taking creative writing if I had the time.\n\nI would recommend checking out the university website for undergraduate student degrees; they should have a section specifically for the courses you're looking for. What I did when I first started was I checked there and browsed through some of the classes they offered, and if I got excited, I added it to a list of courses I'd like to register in if I went to that particular university. \n\nAlso, if you're in Canada, some schools I considered (for Humanities) were the University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, University of Alberta, and McGill University (bc 18 year old me still loved literature so much and couldn't help but take a peek at their English sections).","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1208126177,"likes":0,"timestamp":1620429132,"seconds_elapsed":107146994,"comment":"Yea, going back to what previous anons said, I really appreciate your insight and headcanons on Dazai and BSD as a whole.

Everyone says this but it’s true that Dazai’s character truly is a good depiction of how someone with mental illness/depression is like. I resonate with him sm and love him more than one shld a fictional character, but also like u I do love insulting him it’s just fun🤧 I haven’t gotten to the manga yet, I plan on finally being caught up during the summer since this is my last yr of hs, but I follow enough ppl that I’m always being spoiled (which is fine idrc for spoilers) and I think out of everyone on here I love your analyses the most because I love that you have that connection to the IRLs and their works and reading someone who majors in literature and has read the IRLs works makes me feel so much more knowledgeable and learning even more about these amazing authors and the characters based off them as well, and how Asagiri is amazing for constructing the story the way he does.

If the game is affecting you so negatively, there's nothing wrong with deleting it entirely. (Gacha is notoriously bad tbh, it's built to make us addicted with very little reward). But I also understand how you dedicated so much effort to your account that you don't wanna lose anything.\n\nI stay motivated to keep playing Mayoi mostly because I'm just hyperfixated on it (and maybe I have a mild gambling addicion), but I also have been playing it for long enough that I know how to get max rewards out of it with minimum spending of moons. I think a lot of people tend to just see it as a boring pachinko marble-tossing game with no strategy or tact -- and it is, for the most part -- but there're ways you can apply simple game theory to get as much as you can out of it. I know that sounds so lame, but it's true! Look at your teams' positioning, your Leader Skill, who you pick as a Guest, your scene cards, etc.\n\nAlso, I keep playing because I'm bound to get cards I like eventually, y'know? Even if the odds suck, eventually, I'll get one. And this is also dumb but, when I get cards I *don't* want, I just try my best to be grateful for them. Mayoi doesn't owe me anything and the creators of it are honestly really good to us for the most part. I hope you get more (Chuuya) cards soon. If I could give you luck, I would, but just know I'm cheering for you!! Cry if you need to, but I promise you good things're on their way.

Can you help me to understand, please?\nND is the way autistic people want to be called? Or is it a condition that some autistic people have apart from autism? Or am I confusing everything? \nI seriously want to understand, and I'm so sorry if I say something offensive or inappropriate. \nThank you!!","reply":"Neurodivergence/neurodiversity (ND) is complicated to describe because even within the world of mental health studies it's misunderstood and unfairly compared as neurotypicality's binary opposite. (Like I just looked up a quick Google search definition and the one it gave me was lowkey ableist but whatever).\n\nBasically, it's just when somebody differs from the 'normal' ways society's ascribed mental/emotional functions to be. Autism and ADHD are the most common ones cited on the ND spectrum, but there're a bunch of different ones that fall under the category as well (e.g. OCD, which I have, epilepsy, bipolar, Asperger's, Tourette's, etc.). It's not a condition on its own, but it is an umbrella term for several conditions.\n\nThe reason why I talk about ND in relation to Dazai is that he expresses a lot of common symptoms, traits, and behaviors that neurodiverse people have; mental illness such as chronic depression and substance abuse problems (which IRL Osamu Dazai had) also overlap with ND almost always because of the stigma often associated with both. As far as I know, the original BSD creators never confirmed he's ND canonically, but it's just heavily implied, especially because he's considered \"eccentric,\" \"a gifted genius,\" \"unreadable,\" antisocial, lonely, and a bunch of other descriptors commonly used for ND people.\n\nI hope that helps a bit. I definitely recommend researching more into it; I'm not a psychiatrist so don't take my word as gospel. (Also dw about saying something offensive/inappropriate, I'm honestly grateful somebody asked me instead of jumping to conclusions).","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1207815642,"likes":0,"timestamp":1620167868,"seconds_elapsed":107408258,"comment":"Eu!

I started later than other people my age too so you're definitely not alone! Although, it's really never too late. Life happens and gets in the way; if you're younger than me, then you're /very/ young and don't at all have to figure everything out yet -- especially when it comes to jobs bc the ones younger people tend to get are constantly in flux and chaotic.\n\nI have had jobs before when I was a teenager, but none of them were at all like the jobs other kids were doing. I did freak out about messing up at first -- I think that's natural for anybody new at anything. It did get easier over time, and I also think that's natural so long as you're patient with yourself. Don't get me wrong, there were /a lot/ of stressful situations while I was working (Lord, I had to contact the higher ups out of policy one time because one of the people I was working with sent me horrible messages on my private account it was Not Fun), but overall I handled it. Because I had to, and I could.\n\nYou /will/ figure it out. I do not know you but I 100% know you're capable of more than you think you are and you're not \"behind\" or \"running late\" just because something happened when you were 15/16 that prevented you from being like the other people your age.

I want to start going into writing seriously but don’t kno where to rly start? Like a lot of ppl have told me I’m “good” at it but whenever I’m asked to write a story I panic,, I’ve never rly been serious “I want to write a book” abt it till recently. So far I’ve noted down my weaknesses such as expanding vocabulary and descriptive writing. It’s just I’m usually an over thinker so I always fall into thinking “this needs to be described perfectly” kind of thoughts and ik it’s just going to be detrimental but it’s hard to cut out that habit. Rly sorry abt my rambling tho ig in short I was wondering what works for u when u write?","reply":"No need to apologize! Welcome to the world of writing! You have already started, so do not worry about \"where to start.\" You're already a writer! The first thing I thought when I read your message was \"Oh my gosh babe you don't HAVE to write a book ever.\" Because it's true, you never have to, it isn't a requirement. If you DO want to write a book, I'm not exaggerating when I say it's a LONG process. It takes YEARS to even get a final draft done. Don't think you have to have everything figured out AT ALL. Nobody knows what they're doing ever. Most writers aren't these automatic geniuses who can write a masterpiece just by sitting down for the first try. There is always a first draft, and 1000s that follow. Natural talent is overrated and not all that real; what matters is the work you put into it. Give yourself TIME to learn. Take deep breaths!\n\nI relate a lot to your anxieties, and I'm sure a bunch of writers (even professional ones) do too. I don't want you to think you're alone or odd for having these fears, they're actually really common so don't worry. Literature's been with me all my life; I can't really pinpoint a specific moment when I started \"getting into\" writing seriously. (What even is serious writing? I don't think I've written anything serious ever but I definitely also have lmao). It's cheesy, but what's helped me most with writing was reading. Seriously! The best writers are also readers. I'm not saying pick up a dusty novel or start analyzing Chaucer, God no, I'm saying find a story/stories you really like and ask yourself, \"Why? What did the writer do that made me like it so much?\" Learn from your predecessors! It's an art form, so ofc it's been studied before and you can insert yourself into that world of studying very easily.\n\nLastly, I have an all-or-nothing personality too; it isn't perfectionism exactly but I definitely think \"this needs to be described the exact way I want it to be or I will implode\" and then end up spiraling into nonsense thinking. So I definitely get that it's a really, really hard habit to get rid of, but there's really no magical cure. I think what's important is to acknowledge that you're always going to have that little bit of doubt still -- no matter where you are in your writing journey -- and that it's okay. That anxiety will help you write better. It's wonderful that you've noted down some stuff you need to work on, but always remember to remind yourself about the good stuff + progress you've achieved as well. Since a lot of people are saying you're good, don't forget their comments! Your morale is what's most important.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1204616989,"likes":0,"timestamp":1619199669,"seconds_elapsed":108376457,"comment":"Eu, why do you have so much ability moons in bungo mayoi like u never ran out of it?

(It is, but it's not). Like sometimes you can just write an abstract concept or an idea and nothing even has to happen. Or the plot's really basic. If you want to write a story with just two people sitting on a deck chatting about the universe, and then it ends with them getting up to grab a lemonade, then that's cool! Write that! Plot isn't *everything,* and it doesn't have to be your number one goal. \n\nAlso, there're some online resources you can look at that could give you the basics of a plot + writing like TedEd (This was my favorite video of theirs; it's old but still good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSoRzTtwgP4). Have a look around on YouTube or other places with writing communities; I know that writing tends to feel really solitary but trust me when I say listening to how others figure shit out does wonders.\n\nWhat generally helps me with plot is an outline. This can take numerous forms, obviously, but what I usually do is write down the BIG plot points like \"x character dies here\" or \"big party happens after x\" and then you fill in the little details/blanks in between. It's better to also do it on a piece of paper or Word document so you can move stuff around. You'd be surprised how many books just started out with the author writing like three sentences on a notepad of the cool scenes they wanted to do, and then they just wrote like 300 pages in between each. Also, not everything has to be written in a linear course; some authors write entire novels or series of books just to lead up or build off of *one* scene they wanted to write about. It can orbit around it. You don't have to go from start to finish whatsoever. People tend to think plot is: 1. Introduction 2. Rising Action 3. Climax 4. Falling Action 5. Conclusion, but ofc there's so much more than that, yknow? You don't have to tell everything in the first pages of your work -- hell, you can leave that \"Introduction\" aspect until the very end. \n\nAnd lastly, anybody could go to school and learn how to do the literary mechanics and plot devices, but it takes real imagination to make up the concepts, characters, and setting all by yourself. I can tell you what to do in terms of structure, but the real magic comes from you so definitely don't sell yourself short! You're your best teacher. You've got this.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1204176789,"likes":0,"timestamp":1618987566,"seconds_elapsed":108588560,"comment":"Serious question. How do you write long stories? Is there a technique or advice for that? No matter what story I have in mind, I can't seem to tell it in anything longer than 1 to 2k. Writing 5k is tiring already, where do people seriously get that stamina to even do 50 or 100 or 200k? It's mind-blowingly amazing.","reply":"Uhm, embarrassing true story: When I was in middle school, I would sit down every day after I got home in front of my computer and write down like 30+ page diary entries on whatever the hell it was that came to mind (boys I liked, what I ate for lunch, how much studying sucked, etc.). I'd been writing for fun up until that point obviously, but those three years of me just filling in a Microsoft Document rapid-fire, no editing/no filter made me type faster just because I brain dumped and allowed myself to brain dump. Let yourself brain dump. The only goal of writing a 1st draft is to make it exist. That's it. You made something that didn't exist before and will never exist again the exact way you wrote it, and that's pretty cool.\n\nI'm also a full-time student English major, so I on average write about like 5000-6000+ words of analysis per week (kill me), so I guess I kinda forced myself into writing fast and long. It was definitely a build-up of years and years of writing (and failing, then trying again) to get the \"stamina.\" I know that might sound disheartening because \"Ugh, I don't have the time or energy to dedicate so much into this,\" but, a lot of the time, the people we see as \"talented\" are good at what they do because they worked hard to get there, not because they were born and could naturally bust out a 200k fic in one sitting. From what I'm seeing at least, you're already working hard by asking these kinds of questions.\n\nThat being said, even now I still have an all-or-nothing personality, so whenever I don't meet my set writing goal I actually get irritated with myself 😅😅 I don't know if you're the same, but my best advice is to not get caught up in a set word count because then you're measuring your writing productivity with something numerical and quantitative, rather than qualitative. 1-2k is *a lot,* don't sell yourself short. I know that might sound condescending considering I just told you how much I write on average, but I of all people know how even getting 100 words down sometimes (especially when you have so many ideas) is aggravating. Writing 5k *is* tiring and I think you're already making great steps to get better by just acknowledging that. Writing's hard! Repeat that to yourself over and over and OVER again because it's honestly the most important thing to remember.\n\nI've been with literature all my life, and trust me when I say that word count is not at all everything. There are writers who spend their entire lifetimes revising just one poem -- and sometimes that poem doesn't even end up getting published until way later or isn't even considered their \"masterpiece!\" You're never gonna be able to control a lot of things about what you write, but you can and *should* be patient with yourself. Give yourself the time to figure it out. You're doing just fine.☺️","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1204344850,"likes":0,"timestamp":1618986229,"seconds_elapsed":108589897,"comment":"This is actually pretty basic ik ik but I’m curious, what’s ur zodiac sign?","reply":"On the Chinese Zodiac, I'm a dragon (hehe) and on the Greek one, I'm an Aries! 🥰","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1204211825,"likes":0,"timestamp":1618985999,"seconds_elapsed":108590127,"comment":"Hey Eu!! 💜 Do you think there's any chance someone could get their hands on a hardcover version of Dazai Osamu's ''No longer human''?

And also, do you have any tips on how to get your hands on hardcover versions of books in general? Where do you buy your books, most of the time I mean, if it's not too personal?

The thing is, I don't know if there are translated versions.\n\nAs for how to get hardcover books, I haven't actually thought of it! I live somewhere where they're pretty popular, so you could find hardcover copies most of the time. If you're looking for cheap places to get books, I recommend ThriftBooks (https://www.thriftbooks.com/?&gclid=Cj0KCQjw9_mDBhCGARIsAN3PaFON1bUDU3f6cl5ElF0x4KgTrjBEVp4p9uYunSAA21uS7cfst1ramGcaAtgUEALw_wcB), Alibris (https://bookoutlet.ca/?source=ppc&ppc_campaign=g1040978055&gclid=Cj0KCQjw9_mDBhCGARIsAN3PaFNcS1pAscTaMp4ub62-8S6ykTb1BJrDyeOOk1nO16Vc0Iq3quzgchQaAtsoEALw_wcB), or Better World Books (https://www.betterworldbooks.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw9_mDBhCGARIsAN3PaFNtOrn0UOU7sSupm_mpWUNZa1JB61zTlVEtYBHVcMdfuotXATqp9rQaAveVEALw_wcB). I don't know if they still have it, but last I checked all of these sites have a \"hardcover\" option where you can browse editions that're just hardcover of the book you're looking for. Hope this helps! (Oh also, if you just wanna get free PDF copies of books, go to pdfdrive.com, b-ok.org, or z-lib.org, I share these websites to whoever I can).\n\nAs for where I buy my books, I try my best to get them second-hand and thrifted at whatever bookstore's nearby; it's more environmentally sustainable that way, cheaper, and it's always fun getting an old copy of something that's been well-loved (maybe even annotated 👀👀). I hardly ever buy anything new unless I really want that specific version.

Read it again and again, and again and again. And after that, it still won’t make sense but you’ve probably noticed some things by then, right?\n-Say the poem out loud and pay attention to the sounds your mouth makes. Is there a rhythm? A rhyming pattern? Does it cut off weird in some sentences? Are there interruptions? Allusions? How do these little details affect the poem and how you recited it aloud?\n-Don’t assume that just because a poem is short it’s going to be easy. Short poems are some of the HARDEST to analyze\n-Look up any words you don’t know. If there’re names, dates, and places you don’t know, look it up too!\n-Know the time period when it was written. There’s a huge difference between a Romantic poem and a Shakespearean sonnet.\n-Chances are, the way it makes you feel is probably the intended effect of the poet. Trust your gut on what the tone of the poem is. Does it make you feel sad? Happy? Bitter? If you know the tone, you’re already halfway there.\n-STANZAS ARE STANZAS FOR A REASON you could write entire essays on their structural impact alone\n-Read what other scholars have interpreted in the poems you’re analyzing. Disagree or agree, and explain why.\n-Find a poem you love, then keep finding more. Every one you fall in love with will help you understand so much more than just the poetry.\n-Don’t try to analyze e.e. cummings you will literally hate all poetry if you try to start studying it through *fucking* cummings","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/4.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1199969249,"likes":1,"timestamp":1617959574,"seconds_elapsed":109616552,"comment":"Hi!

I agree with him. My therapist would more or less say the same thing to me (just without the slap), because if you spend so much of your time and energy \"wallowing in self-pity,\" everything will become a \"nightmare.\" It's bottomless and you're essentially digging yourself deeper into an inescapable abyss. That's why Dazai's really interesting as mental illness/ND representation; he isn't stereotypically loathsome of himself or explicit in his self-hatred. He doesn't really focus on the \"I shouldn't have been born\" mindset or let himself delve too far into it -- at least not verbally. He's more seasoned in how to deal with it, but it still evidently hurts him.\n\nHope I answered your question !!

Obviously, it's a case-to-case basis but I would say, yeah, literature as a major is a good thing to study. There are way more job opportunities for it than you think, especially if you get into a good program.\n\nAnd it isn't my place to tell you what to do at all, but hearing people pursuing majors they don't even like for one reason or another is heartbreaking. I relate a lot from personal experience -- for the first 18 years of my life I was told I had to be a doctor. But then I realized I wouldn't stop being unhappy even if I got through med school, or got a job at a hospital, or had a good career in medicine. I just didn't like it. I was good at it, but didn't make me happy. At all. So I transferred (which is a lot more common than people think; my academic guidance counsellor told me on average people change their majors 6-8 times !!).\n\nYou're right that life goes on, but it's important to remember that it's *your* life. We all have to find ways to get by. I know that not everybody can pursue their passion and sometimes a degree is just a degree and a gateway to getting a job, but if it's eating you up inside that you despise it and want something else, I say go for it. I know we don't know each other but I'll be cheering you on!

Or at least its climax. Asagiri knows Dazai's power and narrative potential in terms of what he should and shouldn't keep secret, and what he should reveal and at what times they should come to light. Dazai's elusiveness is meant to be felt by us as well, and it's that curiosity that keeps us coming back and theorizing about him, so it wouldn't be smart to just expose everything right when the series is just reaching its peak. Going by the current arc right now, it isn't Dazai-centric, and there probably won't be a Dazai-centric plotline for a while. It will happen though. Asagiri's building up to it with the little details we do receive about him, and I have faith that it'll be worth the wait.\n\nKeep in mind though that he isn't the main character and therefore isn't a top priority -- at least not as much as Atsushi is for the storyline. Dazai is an important and valuable character -- and a fandom favorite, which Asagiri definitely knows -- so I don't doubt we'll find out more about him eventually. We just need to be patient.\n\nI don't know if Asagir'll make an entire light novel like with Chuuya and Stormbringer.

I like when, in novels, the reader can appreciate main character’s inner thoughts, the stories aren’t predictable and the attention in little details. I enjoyed your essay about bsd and is funny see mochi Dazoo’s pictures too","reply":"I believe literature from any culture possesses its own appeal, but what attracted me the most to Japanese literature was how it approached genres differently from their Western/European counterparts. For example, the Decadence and Aestheticism movement in England was mostly comprised of writers like Oscar Wilde or Charles Baudelaire, and their works are certainly elegant, languid, and related to debauchery, but I found it fascinating that the Japanese Decadence (\"Buraiha\") authors didn't at all write about lazy morning picnics, knick-knacks from abroad, or lounging on setees philosophizing on love, life, and death. The Japanese writers like Ango and Oda approached it differently -- and it's largely because different things were happening in each country. \n\nI like Japanese literature because it's a good gateway into Asian literature studies. Japan arguably thrived the most especially during the 18th to 19th centuries because of its colonial and Pan-Asian agenda, as well as interactions with the West, but that's an entire history lesson for another day. \n\nAh! I could go on and on about Eastern vs. Western viewpoints and approaches to literature. Even defining \"Japanese literature\" versus the rest of the world's literature is difficult because of globalization. I've attended a lot of classes debating what makes something Japanese, or English, or American -- even more complicated when you consider diaspora writers, immigrants, mixed identities, trans-related identities, etc. \n\nBasically, I just like it. I like seeing remnants of Asian history, I like having an Asian-centric narrative written by an Asian person for Asian people, and I like catching small references to culture + language that I just know offhand because of one reason or another.

I want to do a couple of questions but I’ll write them separately. What you recommend to do for someone who wants to read poems? Sometimes I feel like I read poetry without processing author’s message and a part of me wants to read deeper and understand Chuuya and Rimbaud poems","reply":"People get really intimidated by poems bc it's a whole different ballgame from prose, which we're more used to. The best advice I can give is something my hs English teacher gave me: \"Read the poem. Take a deep breath. Know that in the next couple of minutes, you'll understand it more and more.\" Because you will, the longer you sit with it. Or maybe you have to put it away for a while and then come back to it to dissect it more. Whatever works for you!\n\nIt's not productive to expect so much from ourselves. We're not gonna \"understand\" every deep meaning or connect every allusion the first, second, or even hundredth time reading it over. Don't make that your goal. Make the best you can do your motivation, and go from there.\n\nObviously, the best way to read \"deeper\" is to educate yourself on literary devices, patterns, and poetic theory. And in the case of Chūya Nakahara and Arthur Rimbaud's poetry, I would highly encourage research into their lives and historical contexts. \n\nAll in all, though, give yourself time to learn! You're not going to \"get\" everything immediately, or even eventually, and that's okay. Feel free to DM me or ask another question if you want poet recommendations as well!

I think Fukuzawa's the closest to his IRL personality and it's very fitting that he's the leader of the Armed Detective Agency. I did some research about him when I was in my Japanese History class and his influence on the nation extends way beyond just literature, so I'd say BSD Fukuzawa embodies his IRL counterpart very well. Yosano Akiko is a good fit too.\n\nAs for the one LEAST similar to them, I can't really decide, but the first person that comes to mind is F. Scott Fitzgerald. IRL Fitzgerald would honestly hate the ever-living fuck out of his BSD counterpart, which I kind of find hilarious so I forgive Asagiri. The Great Gatsby was literally written to criticize people exactly like him.

I noticed you said you enjoyed Crime & Punishment in one of your earlier replies to someone and I wanted to ask you a question about it because it's my favourite book :) It's about the ending, because when I got to the ending, I was a bit surprised. I was expecting something much much darker than what came to be, because the book ended in a light of hope for Sonya and Raskolnikov, but I was expecting a tragedy. Honestly for the whole book I thought Raskolnikov would die at his own hands in the end, but that's not what happened at all. Anyway, what's your opinion on the ending? I'd love to hear your thoughts since I have no one else to discuss this book with (none of my friends or family read it😓) Thank you and have a nice day🦋💞💞","reply":"The ending made a lot of sense to me when I read it. You're not alone in thinking C&P was going to end on a bleaker, tragic note. It's supposed to be ambiguous because Dostoyevsky's a little shit.\n\nRaskolnikov as a protagonist is the narrative manifestation of crime *and* punishment. He commits the murders very early on in the novel and serves moral, financial, and psychological punishment for it (see: his mental breakdown for 500+ pages). The last thing he needs to do is state-sanctioned punishment. By all accounts and laws, he serves his time, but the ethics of crime AND punishment transcend beyond the arbitrary rules we apply to them. He's significant because he's your regular, run-of-the-mill guy who's just trying to support his family, go to school, and get by in life. He's not a *bad* or *evil* person -- nor does he have ill intentions. Dostoyevsky complicates the good/evil binary, obviously, but he intermingles its consequences with more than just social precepts and rules. He makes it a matter of poor vs. rich, corrupt vs. pure, guilty vs. innocent, etc. -- with no definite statutes that define which is which, or from where they diverge. Yes, Raskolnikov is horrified at what he's done and it's scary how somebody could come to the \"logical conclusion\" to just kill somebody, but it isn't out of nowhere. It isn't pure evil that drives him. His modus operandi wasn't completely stupid. He needed money. Isn't the existence of poverty in and of itself a crime against one's humanity? What's the punishment for such an injustice? Raskolnikov's not the real villain, and the people he killed can't exactly be the villain either bc they're dead, so who is? Is it society? God? Industrialist capitalism that forces people with limited means to literally slaughter the ones in power in order to get ahead in life? Do the moralities we enforce onto people, structures, and our ways of living sustain us for the better? Can we really atone for something our betters deem irredeemable? What's the crime in doing what you think is right? What punishment do you give a hero? Is the crime itself a punishment? Is the punishment a crime?\n\nThere're SO many ways Dostoyevsky plays with this idea. You can honestly write an essay on any of the main characters in relation to this theme. Sonia's a great example bc she's a prostitute, but she's also the purest and most noble one in the story. There's also a lot of religious implications in the ending just because Dostoyevsky never shut up about religion. I recommend doing some research into his life and his time in Siberia -- in relation to his religious beliefs -- because those experiences really impacted his writing of C&P. His books Notes from the Underground and Demons are also worthwhile reads, but C&P on its own is a colossus for analysis anyway. Even without historical context, its themes are timeless. I love it very much.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/1.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1184119416,"likes":1,"timestamp":1613614136,"seconds_elapsed":113961990,"comment":"Heyo there!

Every chapter I feel bad about not commenting because every chapter is just so so good, but I've been writing comments so often the last few weeks and I can't stop myself from rambling, so I'm sitting there like half an hour to an hour simply writing a long-ass comment and that's kinda exhausting.. Especially bc I'm literally pouring all my emotions in the comments and uwah! I feel drained afterward xD (But hey, I managed at least one long-ass comment for your story when I finished reading the available chapters that time) And that's no excuse, you're writing way more than me after all, and that's why I wanted to tell you how much your story inspired me to continue reading more classical books and how much I loved every single word!! Your writing style is simply wonderful. I don't know anything about writing, really, all I know is that reading your stories gives me such a beautiful feeling inside me and I could honestly cry because I love it so so much! Okay, I had to get this out, thanks for listening to my ramblings once again! 💖 Soo but back to my question hehe xD I wanted to ask you what you think about Asagiri-sensei's writing style!! You've already mentioned how brilliant he is for referencing so much literature-connected stuff in his stories, and I agree!! I don't have nearly as much knowledge of literature as you have, but simply by listening to others, I can see how great Asagiri-sensei is. But besides that aspect, what do you think about his style of writing in general? I don't know if or how many Light Novels you've already read and you probably only read the English translation if you've read them, but even if you've only read the manga or watched the anime, what do you think about his storytelling? Gosh, this is one long question and I'm bad with words haha.. Hope you got what I wanted to ask, sorry for the long explanation!","reply":"I wrote an essay about BSD's brilliant storytelling, actually (you can read it here: https://twitter.com/eu_gi_oh/status/1273026416183934976?s=20). As for Asagiri's general writing style, I can't exactly vouch for it in its original form bc I read the manga and the light novels in English. I always try to give translated works more consideration, but most of the time they're not as \"complex\" or \"elaborate\" in the English language as English books. Asagiri's writing, as I've experienced it, isn't too, too noteworthy in terms of general style. You can very much tell just from how he organizes plot points that he's fairly \"new\" to writing, but he is getting better. That being said, this judgment isn't at all that valid bc I'm essentially saying my opinion about the *translator*, not Asagiri's writing itself. \n\nFrom what I can see, the most obvious thing you can catch is how he's definitely done his research. You can tell that a lot of writers have influenced him -- aside from the Japanese ones, I've also read BSD and went, \"Wow *somebody* has read some Fitzgerald\" -- and seeing their styles bleeding through to Asagiri's writing is always endearing. \n\nHis STORYTELLING, however, is immaculate. On top of the references, the way he strings it all together to make sense in a supernatural, surrealist setting is amazing. Making an entirely new world out of nothing is extremely hard --- especially since Asagiri comes from humble backgrounds. The foundations of BSD's plotline have so much potential and he cultivates it very well through the various arcs and side stories. He had a good idea, knows its full potential, and delivers. BSD's underlying themes of hope, love, and healing are also woven into the story so nicely. There are NO black-or-white, binary portrayals of anything. There are nuance and speculation and so much wandering. Agh, I could go on and on about it, but honestly the essay I wrote ^^ explains it in more detail. It's narratively elegant. I'm not saying it's perfect, there's always room for improvement, but BSD is just so beautiful just by existing.\n\nI'm very happy you're getting into classical books and extremely flattered that I had a part in it. 🥺🥺 Also oh my gosh, PLEASE DO NOT FEEL THE NEED TO LEAVE A COMMENT OR WRITE ME ANYTHING !! Just knowing people are reading CIHY and enjoying it is more than enough for me. I'm grateful for any feedback, but please don't feel obligated to comment just because I'm \"writing way more\" -- especially if you feel drained afterward! Take care of yourself first and foremost: that's the best compliment I could ask for.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1184094354,"likes":1,"timestamp":1613612371,"seconds_elapsed":113963755,"comment":"Who are your top 5 BSD characters (well we all know who is going to be number 1 lmao)","reply":"1.

I think I could sit here all day and think of questions to ask you, haha. It's just so nice to have someone to talk to about books and literature! This time I actually wanted to ask you about your fic (long name incoming) ''Can I Help You? -- Or, The Hilariously Ironic Yet Accidentally Romantic Tale Of The Bookshop Cashier Who Never Read And The Literature Major Who Couldn’t Stop'' .... Wow, the name is REALLY long, haha xDD Might just call it Can I Help You instead! Anyway, I wanted to ask you a question about ultra somft and cute Dazai! What are his favorite books? Is there a genre he likes the most? Are there genres or authors or books he'd never read? Oh, also! While I'm at it. What's Chuuya's favorite hobby? Not sure if it was already mentioned in the story or not, but I'm curious! Like, does he draw, is he into gaming, etc, etc. Thanks in advance once again author-chan!!","reply":"You can absolutely call it Can I Help You? omg I refer to it as CIHY whenever I mention it. The ridiculously long title is just a jab at other classical literature that also have hilariously long titles.\n\nJust like IRL Dazai, CIHY Dazai likes Russian literature (very sad, very philosophical, very broody). He's taking a bunch of classes in different genres, but I'd say he loves Gothic/Thriller/Mystery, Bildungsroman, and Decadence. He doesn't like colonial literature (Joseph Conrad, Rudyard Kipling, Edgar Rice Burroughs, etc.), stories solely based on romance/erotica (he likes classic rom-coms though, like Jane Austen and Elizabeth Gaskell), and fantasy fiction. He likes any interesting story though, so any book from any genre could catch his eye if it met his standards. (He's kind of a pretentious snob though, if you couldn't already tell, dear Reader).\n\nChuuya's hobbies are tinkering with robots (even outside of his Robotics club), playing video games (I think he'd be really into Genshin Impact rn), and fixing random stuff around his house (like a repair boy). I haven't written about it yet but he likes teaching Baki tricks as well.\n\n(Thank you for asking about CIHY, you have no idea how happy it's made me.

I wish you a wonderful day, author-chan! Another literature-related question. I wanted to ask you how many and which books related to the bsd universe you've already read? Meaning which ''ability-books'' you've already read! And also, do you have any recommendations for these books and/or authors? I'm already deeply in love with No Longer Human and I'm planning to read And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie (even though it's not confirmed that that's her ability, but I've found the book and the summary sounded so interesting, I had to buy it!) and I'm basically only waiting for the next chance to buy Crime and Punishment and I Am A Cat by Fyodor Dostoevsky and Natsume Sōseki, but I'm still wondering which other books I should read afterward? I really wanna know why Asagiri-sensei chose these authors and books for his story and I get so excited just thinking about it!! And while falling into despair bc I don't know which books I should buy/read next, I remembered that I know a very good and passionate writer and avid reader who has a curious cat and also answers literature-related questions! I hope I'm not bothering you too much, but I'm very grateful for every answer. Thank you so much in advance!!","reply":"Since I'm an English major, I've more or less read most of the Western authors mentioned in BSD -- if not the complete \"Ability-book,\" then excerpts or passages of them just because they're such famous writers. The same applies to the Japanese authors, but only because I like Japanese literature + study it in my own time. So you could say I've read all of them, but not in full. 🥺🥺 I think Asagiri's choices for which works became the BSD characters' Abilities are all justified; the way he intertwined the actual author's life, literary history, *and* the respective literature is nothing short of brilliant.\n\nOf the entire pool, my favorites have been No Longer Human, Crime & Punishment, The Great Gatsby, and Edgar Allan Poe's short stories (\"Murders in the Rue Morgue,\" \"The Black Cat\"). And Then There Were None was my first Agatha Christie book and it made me addicted, so I definitely recommend it! She's my comfort mystery author; whenever I feel down for a quick but fun read, I go to Agatha. Also, I think ATTWN has been confirmed as BSD!Agatha's Ability name in the manga? (I could have imagined it though since it's her most famous book).\n\nThank you for asking! You're not bothering me at all dear, I love answering literature-related questions.

I liked it very much! It was my first time with Henry James' prose and I wasn't as used to studying older texts back then. I'm sure I'd like it more if I looked at it again now. What struck me the most about TotS was how the source of the horror/Gothic came from the children. Back in James' time, children were supposed to have been little angels in the house and not at all cursed and haunted. ToTs brought to the fore the anxieties we tend to associate with the outside -- everything scary is Out There -- into the domestic sphere. He suggested that something so innocent and adorable can carry darker secrets underneath the childlike veneer, and he used it brilliantly. Hope that answers your question!

Once you understand the meaning/definitions behind certain devices you'll be able to find patterns in literature just naturally! Also, don't push yourself too hard about reading \"deeper\" -- a lot of people get mixed up in the analysis part of it but it's sometimes better to look into yourself.

I haven't read all of Vita Sexualis, but I've read enough excerpts of it to have a general idea of what it's about. I wrote an essay briefly mentioning VS and its overall history on Japanese literature (you can read it here: https://twitter.com/eu_gi_oh/status/1345042293821112321?s=20). I don't think it's as sexual as the summaries make it to be by modern standards, but it definitely was very scandalous when it first came out! I'd say it's still a good read as well since Ōgai Mori is such a great writer.\n\nAs for Mori as a character, I find him intriguing just like you do. He's a well-written antagonist, and I have a lot of the same questions you do about his Ability. I wouldn't say I \"like\" him though. If you gave me a choice between BSD Mori and IRL Mori I'd definitely choose the latter. 😅😅\n\nAlso, Elise calls Mori \"Rinatrou\" because \"Mori Ougai\" is his pen name, whereas Rintarō Mori is his real name. He was a war surgeon in the Japanese Army, so his BSD persona is a direct allusion to these little facts.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/3.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1181338012,"likes":0,"timestamp":1612734175,"seconds_elapsed":114841951,"comment":"Do you watch other animes except for BSD?

In the literary world, “classic” actually refers to much older texts—the most well-known ones being Homer’s Iliad + Odyssey and the poet Virgil. These epics come from Greek and Roman mythology! They’re classic bc theyre some of the oldest texts we have. \n\nHowever, in mainstream culture “classic” usually just refers to any old book that got famous. 😅😅 A classic by that standard is just any piece of text thats an outstanding example of a particular style.","media":null,"senderData":{"id":false,"avatar":"https://cats.curiouscat.me/2018/7/2.jpg"},"addresseeData":{"id":19136524,"verified":false,"username":"eu_gi_oh","twitterid":2797225334,"facebookid":false,"facebooklink":false,"answers":2254,"askboxtext":"Hello hello! 🥰🥺💙 Ask Eu anything ☕️ Tone indicators are v much appreciated","avatar":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621531/avatars/19136524.jpg","banner":"https://aws.curiouscat.me/1612621530/banners/19136524.jpg","following":false,"follows_you":false,"is_followed_by_me":false,"is_following_me":false,"stickers":{},"can_receive_gifts":true,"created_at":1612621530,"last_online":null}}},{"type":"post","post":{"id":1181183763,"likes":0,"timestamp":1612655631,"seconds_elapsed":114920495,"comment":"I just saw what it says in this box... what are tone indicators?","reply":"Tone indicators are signifiers you can put at the end of text so people can understand what youre saying better!
